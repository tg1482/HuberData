https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=677.0s	677.0	 Okay, so on the mechanical side, which is obvious to everyone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=680.6s	680.6	 we want to have air flow in, inhale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=684.9s	684.9	 and we need to have air flow out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=686.8s	686.8	 And the reason we need to do this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=689.0s	689.0	 is because for body metabolism, we need oxygen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=693.4s	693.4	 And when oxygen is utilized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=696.1s	696.1	 through the aerobic metabolic process,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=699.7s	699.7	 we produce carbon dioxide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=701.1s	701.1	 And so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=703.3s	703.3	 that we produce, in particular,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=705.4s	705.4	 because the carbon dioxide affects the acid-base balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=708.7s	708.7	 of the blood, the pH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=710.5s	710.5	 And all living cells are very sensitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=714.3s	714.3	 to what the pH value is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=715.7s	715.7	 So your body is very interested in regulating that pH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=719.1s	719.1	 So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=723.5s	723.5	 and we have to get rid of the CO2 that we produce.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=726.4s	726.4	 So how do we generate this air flow?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=729.2s	729.2	 Well, the air comes into the lungs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=731.3s	731.3	 We have to expand the lungs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=732.9s	732.9	 And as the lungs expand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=734.9s	734.9	 basically it's like a balloon that you would pull apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=737.9s	737.9	 The pressure inside that balloon drops,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=740.7s	740.7	 and air will flow into the balloon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=742.2s	742.2	 So we expand, put pressure on the lung to pull it apart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=747.7s	747.7	 That lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=751.8s	751.8	 and air will flow in because pressure outside the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=755.2s	755.2	 is higher than pressure inside the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=757.1s	757.1	 when you're doing this expansion, when you're inhaling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=761.5s	761.5	 What produces that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=762.7s	762.7	 Well, the principal muscle is the diaphragm,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=765.8s	765.8	 which is sitting inside the body just below the lung.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=769.3s	769.3	 And when you want to inhale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=771.5s	771.5	 you basically contract the diaphragm and it pulls it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=775.1s	775.1	 And as it pulls it down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=776.7s	776.7	 it's inserting pressure forces on the lung,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=779.6s	779.6	 the lung wants to expand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=786.1s	786.1	 and therefore expanding the cavity, the thoracic cavity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=791.1s	791.1	 At the end of inspiration,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=799.2s	799.2	 You pull down a spring and you let go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=801.1s	801.1	 and it relaxes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=809.7s	809.7	 At rest, it's passive.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=840.7s	840.7	 and then above the spinal cord,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=914.5s	914.5	 which I can go into detail,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2488.1s	2488.1	 It was a bit of a mystery.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2493.6s	2493.6	 They gave bigger breaths and the mortality rate dropped.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2511.1s	2511.1	 and then one big breath,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2523.8s	2523.8	 if you watch, every couple of minutes,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2540.6s	2540.6	 where you need a big pressure to pop it open,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2567.7s	2567.7	 how is this happening?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2571.0s	2571.0	 What's doing it?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2578.6s	2578.6	 typical of the way a lot of science gets done.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2602.1s	2602.1	 lots of things happen in the body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2631.4s	2631.4	 that when you stress, you sigh more.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2639.0s	2639.0	 Bombosome is relatively cheap to buy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2659.6s	2659.6	 and if bombosome did nothing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2662.1s	2662.1	 nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the bombosome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2665.2s	2665.2	 But if it did something, it might be of some interest.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2670.6s	2670.6	 and he comes to me, he says,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2679.8s	2679.8	 And it was in a rat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2701.9s	2701.9	 a very, very fine glass needle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2715.0s	2715.0	 it was localized to the pre-Batzinger,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2720.0s	2720.0	 And I would add that that was an important experiment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2723.1s	2723.1	 to deliver the bombosome directly to that site,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2726.1s	2726.1	 because one could have concluded

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2732.7s	2732.7	 rather than directly increased sign.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2735.0s	2735.0	 Amongst hundreds of other possible interpretations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2740.3s	2740.3	 and that goes back to what I said at the very beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2743.2s	2743.2	 Knowing where this is happening

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2755.9s	2755.9	 We said, okay, what happens if we take the cells

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2875.9s	2875.9	 is that when a ligand binds to a receptor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2881.3s	2881.3	 that is when a molecule binds to its receptor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2884.3s	2884.3	 in many cases, that receptor ligand complex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2889.1s	2889.1	 gets pulled inside the cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2890.9s	2890.9	 So it goes from the membrane in the cell inside the cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2893.5s	2893.5	 So like you can't go to the dance alone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2895.1s	2895.1	 but if you're coupled up, you get in the door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2897.3s	2897.3	 That's right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2903.1s	2903.1	 the peptide binds to its receptor,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2908.8s	2908.8	 saprin does the same thing that ricin does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2911.8s	2911.8	 It kills the cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2913.1s	2913.1	 But then it can't go into the next cell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2914.9s	2914.9	 So the only cells that get killed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2917.8s	2917.8	 or the more polite term ablated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2920.3s	2920.3	 are cells that express that receptor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2923.9s	2923.9	 So if you have a big conglomeration of cells,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2926.8s	2926.8	 you have a few thousand and only 50 of them
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2929.6s	2929.6	 express that receptor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2931.9s	2931.9	 then you inject the saprin conjugated to the ligand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2935.5s	2935.5	 to the peptide, and only those 50 cells die.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2943.7s	2943.7	 inject it into the pre-Budsen complex of rats,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=2951.9s	2951.9	 to actually ablate cells.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3504.0s	3504.0	 and I didn't care whether he was gonna outcompete me,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3601.5s	3601.5	 is I have a flight to catch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3753.6s	3753.6	 whether or not the breathing part of meditation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3756.9s	3756.9	 has anything to do with the purported effects of meditation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3760.3s	3760.3	 So I signed up for the course, and as I joked to you before,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3764.4s	3764.4	 I had two goals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3766.0s	3766.0	 One was to see whether or not breathing had an effect,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3769.6s	3769.6	 and the other was to levitate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3771.7s	3771.7	 because I grew up with all these kung fu things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3774.5s	3774.5	 and all the monks could levitate when they meditated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3776.8s	3776.8	 so why not?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3779.7s	3779.7	 You know, we have a mile in the lab.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3781.4s	3781.4	 You can't do anything interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3782.7s	3782.7	 if you're afraid of failing, and if I fail to levitate,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3786.0s	3786.0	 well, at least I tried.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3788.0s	3788.0	 And I should tell you now, I still haven't done it yet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3790.1s	3790.1	 but I haven't given up yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3791.9s	3791.9	 I haven't given up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3794.2s	3794.2	 So I took this course in mindfulness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3797.2s	3797.2	 and it became apparent to me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3801.0s	3801.0	 that the breathing part was actually critical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3804.2s	3804.2	 It wasn't simply a distraction or a focus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3807.4s	3807.4	 You know, they could have had you move your index finger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3812.0s	3812.0	 to the same effect, but I really believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3814.3s	3814.3	 that the breathing part was involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3816.6s	3816.6	 Now, I'm not an unbiased observer,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3819.7s	3819.7	 so the question is, how can I demonstrate that?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3824.6s	3824.6	 I didn't feel competent to do experiments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3826.6s	3826.6	 in humans, and I didn't feel I could design
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3830.0s	3830.0	 the right experiments in humans,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3831.2s	3831.2	 but I felt maybe I could study this in rodents.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3835.3s	3835.3	 So we got this idea that we were gonna teach rodents
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3838.7s	3838.7	 to meditate, and you know, that's laughable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3844.6s	3844.6	 but we said, but if we can,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3848.2s	3848.2	 then we can actually study how this happens.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3852.2s	3852.2	 So believe it or not, I was able to get a sort of a starter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3857.8s	3857.8	 grant, an R21 from NCCIH.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3861.2s	3861.2	 That's the National Complementary Medicine Institute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3865.9s	3865.9	 A wonderful institute I should mention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3867.8s	3867.8	 Our government puts major tax dollars
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3872.0s	3872.0	 toward studies of things like meditation, breath work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3875.3s	3875.3	 supplements, herbs, acupuncture.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3878.3s	3878.3	 This is, I think, not well known,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3881.2s	3881.2	 and it's an incredible thing that our government does that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3886.1s	3886.1	 and I think it deserves a nod, and more funding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3889.6s	3889.6	 I totally agree with you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3891.0s	3891.0	 I think that it's the kind of thing that many of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3894.3s	3894.3	 including many scientists, thinks is too woo-woo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3897.8s	3897.8	 and unsubstantiated, but we're learning more and more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3902.1s	3902.1	 We used to laugh at neuroimmunology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3904.0s	3904.0	 that the nervous system didn't have anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3905.5s	3905.5	 to do with the immune system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3907.1s	3907.1	 And pain itself can influence your immune system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3911.5s	3911.5	 I mean, there are all these things that we're learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3913.6s	3913.6	 that we used to dismiss, and I think there's real nuggets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3918.3s	3918.3	 to be learned here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3920.0s	3920.0	 So they went out and they funded this particular project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3925.8s	3925.8	 And now I'm gonna leap ahead, because for three years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3929.2s	3929.2	 we threw stuff up against the wall that didn't work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3932.6s	3932.6	 And recently, we had a major breakthrough.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3938.0s	3938.0	 We found a protocol by which we can get mice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3942.8s	3942.8	 to breathe slowly, or wake mice to breathe slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3947.6s	3947.6	 I won't tell you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3948.6s	3948.6	 Normally they don't breathe slowly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3949.9s	3949.9	 No, no, in other words, whatever their normal breath is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3952.2s	3952.2	 we could slow it down by a factor of 10,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3955.3s	3955.3	 and they're fine doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3956.7s	3956.7	 So we could do that for, we did that 30 minutes a day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3961.7s	3961.7	 for four weeks, okay, like a breath practice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3965.8s	3965.8	 Do they levitate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3967.8s	3967.8	 We haven't measured that yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3985.4s	3985.4	 In any case, we then tested them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3990.8s	3990.8	 And we had control animals, mice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=3994.6s	3994.6	 where we did everything the same,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4168.4s	4168.4	 One of the issues I think for a lot of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4171.7s	4171.7	 is that there's a placebo effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4174.4s	4174.4	 That is, in humans, they can respond to something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4178.2s	4178.2	 even though the mechanism has nothing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4180.5s	4180.5	 with what the intervention is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4187.6s	4187.6	 has a big component, which is a placebo effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4191.7s	4191.7	 My mice don't believe in the placebo effect.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4198.3s	4198.3	 it is convincing in ways that no matter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4207.0s	4207.0	 In mice, it's a non-issue.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4230.8s	4230.8	 Because we don't, presumably they're not thinking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4232.9s	4232.9	 about their third eye center, lotus position, levitation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4243.1s	4243.1	 is deliberately slowed or is slowed relative

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4250.5s	4250.5	 What was the frequency of sighing during that 30 minutes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4253.4s	4253.4	 I don't know yet.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4266.3s	4266.3	 that creates a shorter fear response to a foot shock.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4336.0s	4336.0	 where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4342.0s	4342.0	 they got profound changes in breathing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4652.4s	4652.4	 Because I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4655.9s	4655.9	 when I tell you, ask you to smile,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4689.0s	4689.0	 you believe it, they're not faking it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4693.0s	4693.0	 And I don't think everyone could do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4695.1s	4695.1	 I think that the individuals who are able to do that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4698.2s	4698.2	 have some connection to the parts

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4705.1s	4705.1	 Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4708.0s	4708.0	 but I think that this could be imaged.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4709.5s	4709.5	 So I would like to get one of these great actors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4713.0s	4713.0	 in a imager and have them go through that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4716.0s	4716.0	 and then get a normal person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4718.4s	4718.4	 and see whether or not they can emulate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4720.5s	4720.5	 And I think you're gonna find big differences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4722.8s	4722.8	 in the way they control the emotive thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4725.0s	4725.0	 So there's emotive control of the facial muscles,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4728.4s	4728.4	 I think is in large part similar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4730.7s	4730.7	 to your emotive control of breathing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4732.5s	4732.5	 So there's that emotive control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4734.9s	4734.9	 and there's that volitional control and they're different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4738.3s	4738.3	 They're different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4740.3s	4740.3	 Now, you asked me about the yackle stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4743.8s	4743.8	 The yackle paper had to do with ascending,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4750.5s	4750.5	 What Kevin found was that there was a population of neurons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4755.8s	4755.8	 in the pre-Butzinger complex

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4775.7s	4775.7	 Exactly, exactly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4778.4s	4778.4	 And influence mood and you've had podcasts about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4781.8s	4781.8	 I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on with the amygdala.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4784.2s	4784.2	 So, excuse me, the locus coeruleus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4786.6s	4786.6	 So you get into the locus coeruleus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4788.9s	4788.9	 you can now spray information out

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4822.1s	4822.1	 Not why bother paying attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4823.5s	4823.5	 but why would the brain bother to have these inputs?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4826.4s	4826.4	 So what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwartz
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4830.9s	4830.9	 and Lieschen Loosler is they killed ablated,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4848.4s	4848.4	 that they became calmer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4851.8s	4851.8	 but they weren't really capable of high arousal states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=4855.5s	4855.5	 They were kind of flat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5059.1s	5059.1	 you'll see that there's a huge respiratory modulation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5245.2s	5245.2	 Well, CO2 is easy to measure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5257.3s	5257.3	 Well, I imagine that these devices that we're all wearing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5261.2s	5261.2	 will soon be able to measure,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5323.0s	5323.0	 that's originating somewhere in your motor cortex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5326.2s	5326.2	 That is not, of course, that's gonna go down

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5341.7s	5341.7	 None of them that are exclusive.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5347.1s	5347.1	 that if you block nasal breathing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5352.0s	5352.0	 you still see breathing-related oscillations in the brain.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5371.6s	5371.6	 that oscillations may be playing in signal processing?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5423.5s	5423.5	 is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=5437.8s	5437.8	 it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6714.0s	6714.0	 let's say the peak of the oscillation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6718.5s	6718.5	 on the relative timing and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6720.5s	6720.5	 those two signals came in at the same time,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6728.1s	6728.1	 spouting, you know, talking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6733.5s	6733.5	 in many different frequency ranges

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6777.9s	6777.9	 that is you can readily change it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6783.1s	6783.1	 that slow signal for anything,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6791.3s	6791.3	 you now change it, that signal processing has to change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6797.0s	6797.0	 And as that signal processing changes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6800.4s	6800.4	 acutely, there's a change.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6803.4s	6803.4	 So, you asked about breath practice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6806.4s	6806.4	 how long do you have to do it?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6818.6s	6818.6	 So even if it's-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6819.4s	6819.4	 Or a sigh.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6827.4s	6827.4	 Now it doesn't have a permanent change,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6831.2s	6831.2	 but when I'm getting up to bat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6832.8s	6832.8	 or getting up to the first tee,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6834.0s	6834.0	 or getting to give a big talk,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6835.4s	6835.4	 or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6839.2s	6839.2	 a deep breath or a few deep breaths

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6851.3s	6851.3	 but on the other hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6854.4s	6854.4	 let's take something like depression.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6869.3s	6869.3	 as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6874.4s	6874.4	 And they can get so strong, you can't break them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6877.5s	6877.5	 So you can imagine depression being something going on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6881.3s	6881.3	 and on, and on, and you can't break it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6886.4s	6886.4	 to certain levels of depression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6887.9s	6887.9	 I mean, all of us get depressed at some point,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6900.8s	6900.8	 Well, there are extreme measures to break it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=6903.3s	6903.3	 We could do electric-convulsive shock.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=7742.3s	7742.3	 if I have inputs to a neuron, and I get LTP,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLgKkG44MGo&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=81&pp=iAQB&t=7788.0s	7788.0	 of magnesium in the bathing solution.
