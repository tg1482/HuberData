https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 It turns out you can do this using physiology and neuroscience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=19.3s	19.3	 Your breathing can directly impact your heart rate and your level of stress or calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 Here's how it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=26.3s	26.3	 When you inhale, your diaphragm moves down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=30.3s	30.3	 This creates more space in your thoracic cavity and your heart actually gets a little bit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=35.8s	35.8	 As a consequence, the rate of blood flow through that larger heart volume slows down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=41.5s	41.5	 A signal is sent from a group of neurons on your heart called the sinoatrial node.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=46.3s	46.3	 That signal goes up to the brain and your brain sends a signal to speed the heart up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=51.5s	51.5	 In other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=55.6s	55.6	 The opposite is true as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=57.4s	57.4	 When you exhale, your diaphragm moves up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=60.6s	60.6	 Your heart gets a little bit smaller because there's a little bit less space in your thoracic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=64.3s	64.3	 cavity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=65.5s	65.5	 As a consequence, blood flows more quickly through that smaller volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=69.5s	69.5	 The sinoatrial node registers that and sends a signal to your brain and the brain sends
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=74.7s	74.7	 a signal to slow the heart down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=77.5s	77.5	 So in other words, inhaling speeds your heart rate up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=81.0s	81.0	 Exhaling slows your heart rate down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=82.9s	82.9	 So if you want to speed up your heart rate and be more alert, inhale more or make those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=87.9s	87.9	 inhales more vigorous, more intense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=91.7s	91.7	 If you want to calm down, you can do that quickly by making your exhales slightly longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=96.4s	96.4	 than your inhales or making them more vigorous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=100.0s	100.0	 This doesn't require any breath work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=101.6s	101.6	 This is something that you can do in real time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=104.3s	104.3	 And that's what's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=107.9s	107.9	 That's the technical phrase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=109.3s	109.3	 It's also the basis of what's called heart rate variability or HRV.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=113.5s	113.5	 But all you need to remember is inhaling deeper and longer will speed your heart rate up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-GvIOhcf8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=124&pp=iAQB&t=118.7s	118.7	 Exhaling longer and more intensely will slow your heart rate down and will allow you to
