https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=14.8s	14.8	 Today, we are going to talk about the psychology
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=16.8s	16.8	 and the biology of desire, love, and attachment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=30.8s	30.8	 And indeed, the mechanisms we are going to discuss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=33.3s	33.3	 almost certainly were at play thousands of years ago,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=37.5s	37.5	 and no doubt will still be at play in our minds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=40.2s	40.2	 and in our bodies and in our psychologies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=42.4s	42.4	 for the decades, centuries, and thousands of years to come.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=45.7s	45.7	 Indeed, today I want to focus on core mechanisms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=49.0s	49.0	 that lead individuals to seek out other individuals

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=63.2s	63.2	 or to seek relationships on the side, so-called infidelity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=66.5s	66.5	 I'm certainly not going to encourage or discourage

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=69.3s	69.3	 I'm simply going to cover the peer-reviewed scientific data
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=72.7s	72.7	 on all these aspects of desire, love, and attachment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=76.9s	76.9	 I'm going to discuss how our childhood attachment styles,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=80.3s	80.3	 as they're called, influence our adult attachment styles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=84.8s	84.8	 Yes, you heard that right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=86.0s	86.0	 How we attached or did not attach to primary caregivers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=119.3s	119.3	 but indeed that is true.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=241.5s	241.5	 Okay, now there was also a study that was done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=244.9s	244.9	 where women at different stages of their menstrual cycle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=259.5s	259.5	 as more attractive than at other stages of their cycle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=265.3s	265.3	 there seems to be something special
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=267.2s	267.2	 about the pre-obulatory phase of a woman's menstrual cycle

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=298.7s	298.7	 It was more of a continuum rather,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=300.3s	300.3	 rated according to body symmetry and face symmetry.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=314.4s	314.4	 of the cycle seems to create a bi-directional

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=322.0s	322.0	 does really seem to have something to do with ovulation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=345.3s	345.3	 And also women taking oral contraception

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=357.2s	357.2	 that it is not the case that oral contraception

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=373.2s	373.2	 it prevented them from preferring more symmetrical men

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=392.7s	392.7	 in their menstrual cycle influences both men's perception

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1568.2s	1568.2	 of the child in response to the mother leaving

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1573.8s	1573.8	 to the stranger that is in the room with them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1581.1s	1581.1	 In the nomenclature of this kind of study,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1583.6s	1583.6	 these are the so-called B babies,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1591.0s	1591.0	 The secure attachment style is one in which the child
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1595.8s	1595.8	 will engage with the stranger, with the experimenter,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1599.1s	1599.1	 while the parent is present in the room,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1604.5s	1604.5	 but when the parent or other caregiver leaves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1607.9s	1607.9	 the child does get visibly upset.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1610.0s	1610.0	 They might whine, they might cry,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1611.5s	1611.5	 they might even tantrum a bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1613.5s	1613.5	 However, when the caregiver,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1615.9s	1615.9	 meaning the mother or father or other caregiver returns,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1619.4s	1619.4	 the child visibly expresses happiness

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1627.8s	1627.8	 And again, this is all preverbal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1631.7s	1631.7	 how they feel with words.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1636.8s	1636.8	 feels confident that the caregiver is available

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1648.2s	1648.2	 the parent doesn't come right back into the room,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1655.6s	1655.6	 that the parent will come back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1669.6s	1669.6	 they will explore more broadly, literally in space,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1725.3s	1725.3	 and show very little emotion

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=1734.0s	1734.0	 or anxious avoidant and kind of insecure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2465.5s	2465.5	 and how they influence adult romantic attachments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2468.7s	2468.7	 and certainly if you are a parent,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2471.4s	2471.4	 I would encourage you to check out the book, Attached.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2485.8s	2485.8	 or child caregiver attachment are repurposed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2494.8s	2494.8	 What do they do?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2507.3s	2507.3	 As I've talked about before on this podcast,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=2516.7s	2516.7	 to anything as complex as desire, love or attachment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3431.7s	3431.7	 so-called ecstasy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3437.0s	3437.0	 the two neural circuits that use dopamine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3440.5s	3440.5	 that use serotonin and oxytocin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3442.8s	3442.8	 and that collaborate with the autonomic nervous system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3446.1s	3446.1	 to drive what we call desire, love and attachment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3449.4s	3449.4	 And the three circuits are autonomic nervous system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3453.8s	3453.8	 We talked about that one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3455.3s	3455.3	 Then there's the nervous system components
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3457.9s	3457.9	 or the neural circuits for empathy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3460.1s	3460.1	 for being able to see and respond to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3463.7s	3463.7	 and indeed match the emotional tone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3466.7s	3466.7	 or the autonomic tone of another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3469.5s	3469.5	 And then there's the third category,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3471.2s	3471.2	 and this might surprise some of you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3472.4s	3472.4	 It certainly surprised me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3473.8s	3473.8	 but the data point to the fact that the third neural circuit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3476.9s	3476.9	 that's very important for establishing bonds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3479.8s	3479.8	 is one associated with positive delusions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3482.8s	3482.8	 So given that the neural circuits for empathy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3484.6s	3484.6	 are absolutely crucial for falling in love

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3490.3s	3490.3	 I'd like to talk about those neural circuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3491.8s	3491.8	 and what they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3493.3s	3493.3	 Now, often when we hear empathy, we think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3495.6s	3495.6	 oh, empathy is really about listening to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3498.5s	3498.5	 and really understanding what somebody else is feeling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3501.6s	3501.6	 maybe even feeling what they're feeling.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3504.0s	3504.0	 And indeed that's the case,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3505.5s	3505.5	 but what do we mean by that, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3507.6s	3507.6	 What is it to feel what another feels?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3509.9s	3509.9	 Well, what it means is that their seesaw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3513.2s	3513.2	 is driving your seesaw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3516.0s	3516.0	 or your seesaw is somehow driving their seesaw,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3519.7s	3519.7	 that there's a match in terms of the tilt of those seesaws.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3522.6s	3522.6	 Now it doesn't have to be an exact match, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3524.6s	3524.6	 If someone that you really care about is very, very stressed,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3528.7s	3528.7	 you could also become very stressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3530.3s	3530.3	 That's a form of empathic matching,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3533.0s	3533.0	 and there are indeed neural circuits for that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3534.7s	3534.7	 I'll describe what those neural circuits are in a moment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3537.2s	3537.2	 but sometimes the best role for us to take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3539.7s	3539.7	 is actually one in which we are calm

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3545.8s	3545.8	 is very, very anxious.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3551.2s	3551.2	 can be good or bad for the stability of a relationship

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3565.3s	3565.3	 to go into the same state as the other.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3569.9s	3569.9	 to not go into the same state as the other.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3575.9s	3575.9	 is that when we talk about emotional matching or empathy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3579.0s	3579.0	 or going into the same state

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3615.5s	3615.5	 and to some extent matching of autonomic nervous systems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3618.7s	3618.7	 Let me explain what I mean.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3620.9s	3620.9	 Last I checked, the only way that new humans can be created
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3624.7s	3624.7	 is by way of sperm meeting egg,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3627.1s	3627.1	 either in body or in dish, but sperm meets egg.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3636.5s	3636.5	 The process of bringing sperm to egg, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3654.2s	3654.2	 and in this case, I mean actually someone to mate with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3656.1s	3656.1	 typically, while scenarios vary,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=3664.9s	3664.9	 of the so-called sympathetic nervous system.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5171.8s	5171.8	 this brain area above the roof of your mouth,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5186.6s	5186.6	 such that dopamine and testosterone tend to operate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5197.3s	5197.3	 collaborate with the estrogen system

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5206.2s	5206.2	 or I guess better stated,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5213.5s	5213.5	 when you look at the animal and human data.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5223.3s	5223.3	 and scientifically and neurobiologically grounded liberties

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5242.6s	5242.6	 The four categories are,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5254.0s	5254.0	 It doesn't mean they have low anything else,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5256.8s	5256.8	 but they are high on the dopamine scale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5259.5s	5259.5	 People who rate high on the dopamine scale

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5304.9s	5304.9	 But they don't tend to make people calm and relaxed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5325.6s	5325.6	 they tend to like rules and follow rules.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5341.4s	5341.4	 the testosterone category of high testosterone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5347.7s	5347.7	 And then the estrogen category again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5351.0s	5351.0	 could be males or females.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5368.5s	5368.5	 Now that might seem like an unfair kind of overgeneralization,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=5408.0s	5408.0	 that fall into the high sensation-seeking,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6102.7s	6102.7	 where the left hemisphere was more active than the right

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6126.0s	6126.0	 to start looking at neural synchronization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6128.2s	6128.2	 between individuals.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6134.3s	6134.3	 and the way I would have thought this would all go was,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6137.2s	6137.2	 okay, two people start kissing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6138.8s	6138.8	 they start talking about what they find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6140.6s	6140.6	 particularly romantic and arousing for them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6142.4s	6142.4	 and their brain waves will just match to one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6144.8s	6144.8	 And that's really the basis of romantic attachment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6148.6s	6148.6	 and romantic engagement in that sort of thing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6156.3s	6156.3	 So a really nice study published in a really fine journal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6160.8s	6160.8	 Cerebral Cortex is a journal that I've known about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6177.0s	6177.0	 And the title of this paper is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6178.7s	6178.7	 "'Brain knows who is on the same wavelength.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6188.8s	6188.8	 They looked at the resting or default mode activity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6195.9s	6195.9	 where people are kissing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6209.2s	6209.2	 but allows you to look deep into the brain.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6282.2s	6282.2	 the director and the nurturer,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6291.5s	6291.5	 which to my knowledge hasn't happened yet,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6578.7s	6578.7	 In set two, what is your most treasured memory?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6583.4s	6583.4	 So these are, as you can tell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6584.9s	6584.9	 are drilling a little bit deeper
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6586.0s	6586.0	 into one's personal experience and emotional system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6589.3s	6589.3	 And then set three, questions 25 through 36,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6594.6s	6594.6	 are things, what is a very embarrassing moment in your life?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6600.3s	6600.3	 When did you last cry in front of another person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6603.3s	6603.3	 and by yourself?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6605.0s	6605.0	 What is something that's too serious to be joked about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6607.1s	6607.1	 So it's going deeper into one's emotional system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6611.0s	6611.0	 And even questions like, of all the people in your family,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6613.8s	6613.8	 whose death would you find most disturbing and why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6616.7s	6616.7	 So pretty heavy stuff there at the end.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6619.2s	6619.2	 Now, the reason this article got so much traction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6621.7s	6621.7	 and the reason I'm bringing it up today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6623.0s	6623.0	 is that there was a statement that was made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6626.8s	6626.8	 in and around this article that if two people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6630.9s	6630.9	 went on a date or simply sat down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6634.0s	6634.0	 and asked each other these questions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6636.5s	6636.5	 and each answered these questions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6639.5s	6639.5	 and the other was paying attention carefully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6643.2s	6643.2	 and at some level, emotionally responding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6647.2s	6647.2	 or not responding, but certainly paying attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6649.3s	6649.3	 to the answers of the other person,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6651.2s	6651.2	 that by the end of that exchange
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6654.0s	6654.0	 where one person asks 36 questions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6658.6s	6658.6	 and then the other person asks all 36
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6661.3s	6661.3	 and the other person answers all 36,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6665.7s	6665.7	 Which seems like kind of a ridiculous thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6668.2s	6668.2	 And yet it is the case that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6671.6s	6671.6	 who go through this exercise report feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6675.6s	6675.6	 as if they know the other person quite well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6677.7s	6677.7	 and feeling certain levels of attachment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6681.3s	6681.3	 or even love and desire for the other person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6683.8s	6683.8	 that they would not have predicted, excuse me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6687.2s	6687.2	 would not have predicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6689.3s	6689.3	 had they not gone through that process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6691.2s	6691.2	 So what's going on in this exchange of questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6693.1s	6693.1	 and answers of a progressively more emotional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6696.7s	6696.7	 and deep level?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6698.6s	6698.6	 Well, what I predict is going on is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6700.6s	6700.6	 inside of that exchange,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6703.1s	6703.1	 people are creating a sort of delusional story
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6706.1s	6706.1	 about the nature of the exchange being a reflection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6709.6s	6709.6	 of some deeper attachment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6711.3s	6711.3	 And so even though people are just exchanging words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6714.0s	6714.0	 they're not physically touching,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6716.6s	6716.6	 they are not at least not at the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6718.3s	6718.3	 where they're running these kinds of questionnaire studies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6723.5s	6723.5	 they may touch afterwards for all I know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6725.4s	6725.4	 and probably did in some cases,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6727.4s	6727.4	 but they're not exchanging life experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6729.8s	6729.8	 in an immediate way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6731.3s	6731.3	 They're not actually going off into the world
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6733.1s	6733.1	 and doing things together yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6735.1s	6735.1	 They are simply exchanging narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6737.8s	6737.8	 But we know based on recent studies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6741.3s	6741.3	 and I've covered this before on this podcast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6743.5s	6743.5	 but I'll mention again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6744.3s	6744.3	 there was a study published in Cell Reports,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6747.3s	6747.3	 a cell press journal, excellent journal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6749.4s	6749.4	 showing that when individuals listen to the same narrative,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6753.9s	6753.9	 their heart rates tend to synchronize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6755.6s	6755.6	 or at least follow a very similar pattern,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6757.8s	6757.8	 even if they're not in the same room
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6759.5s	6759.5	 listening to a given narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6761.2s	6761.2	 Whereas in this case, people are facing one another,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6764.2s	6764.2	 listening to the narratives of each other,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6766.7s	6766.7	 certainly they are having autonomic responses.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6770.0s	6770.0	 And it stands to reason
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6771.6s	6771.6	 that their autonomic nervous systems are synchronizing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6774.2s	6774.2	 much in the same way that the Cell Reports study found
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6776.7s	6776.7	 that people will synchronize their autonomic nervous systems

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6786.3s	6786.3	 watch a movie, listen to a song,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6791.3s	6791.3	 our autonomic nervous systems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6792.9s	6792.9	 have the potential to map onto one another.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6795.0s	6795.0	 So I'm not all that surprised
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6797.2s	6797.2	 that people find that they fall in love, in quotes,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6806.9s	6806.9	 is they establish a narrative.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6809.0s	6809.0	 They establish a very personal narrative

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6812.9s	6812.9	 and we don't have physiological or brain imaging studies

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6818.7s	6818.7	 but the reasonable interpretation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6821.6s	6821.6	 is that that's causing some sort of autonomic synchronization.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6825.5s	6825.5	 So if you want to try this on a date
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6827.5s	6827.5	 or even it's actually been hypothesized

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6833.6s	6833.6	 even if they already know the answers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=6836.0s	6836.0	 and that doesn't surprise me either.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=7497.2s	7497.2	 that their actual perception of others is changing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8075.1s	8075.1	 yes, testosterone and some of its other forms

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8091.5s	8091.5	 with libido and mating behavior,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8127.8s	8127.8	 that can shift libido in both men and women

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8148.7s	8148.7	 because dopamine is involved in motivation and drive,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8184.5s	8184.5	 in sexual activity, in seeking and actual mating behavior,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8218.1s	8218.1	 for people that are taking substances

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8223.6s	8223.6	 in order to increase libido,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8229.8s	8229.8	 because depending on whether or not that dopamine level

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8247.5s	8247.5	 into a chronic pursuit, but an inability to perform sexually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8251.0s	8251.0	 And this is true for men and women.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8254.2s	8254.2	 So I would just caution people against just thinking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8257.2s	8257.2	 oh, a lack of libido is simply a lack of dopamine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8260.8s	8260.8	 That is not the case.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMRph_BvHB4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=76&pp=iAQB&t=8262.0s	8262.0	 It could be from lower levels of dopamine,
