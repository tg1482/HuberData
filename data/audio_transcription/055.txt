https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=510.5s	510.5	 Because I associate you with a statement,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=513.6s	513.6	 aging is a disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=515.7s	515.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=516.6s	516.6	 Well, so longevity is the more academic way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=519.6s	519.6	 we describe what we research.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=521.4s	521.4	 Anti-aging is kind of the same thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=523.7s	523.7	 but it's got a bad rap because it's been used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=525.7s	525.7	 by a whole bunch of people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=526.6s	526.6	 that don't know what they're talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=528.4s	528.4	 So I really don't like that term, anti-aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=530.7s	530.7	 But aging as a disease and longevity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=532.6s	532.6	 are perfectly valid ways to talk about this subject.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=536.7s	536.7	 So let's talk about aging as a disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=538.9s	538.9	 When I started my research, disease,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=541.8s	541.8	 here at Harvard Medical School,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=544.1s	544.1	 it was considered, if there's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=546.2s	546.2	 that's wrong with you and it's a rare thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=550.2s	550.2	 has to be less than 50% of the population,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=552.8s	552.8	 that's definitely a disease.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=554.3s	554.3	 And then people work their whole lives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=556.1s	556.1	 to try and cure that condition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=558.4s	558.4	 And so I looked up what's the definition of aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=560.3s	560.3	 And it says, well, it's a deterioration in health
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=562.7s	562.7	 and sickness and you can die from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=564.4s	564.4	 Typically you do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=566.3s	566.3	 So I'm thinking that sounds pretty much like a disease,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=568.8s	568.8	 but the caveat is that if more than half the population
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=572.4s	572.4	 gets this condition, aging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=574.9s	574.9	 it's put in a different bucket,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=576.5s	576.5	 which is, first of all, that's outrageous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=578.1s	578.1	 because it's just a totally arbitrary cutoff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=580.9s	580.9	 But think about this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=581.7s	581.7	 that we're ignoring the major cause of all these diseases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=585.5s	585.5	 Aging is 80 to 90% the cause of heart disease, Alzheimer's.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=589.3s	589.3	 If we didn't get old and our bodies stayed youthful,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=592.1s	592.1	 we would not get those diseases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=593.5s	593.5	 And actually what we're showing in my lab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=594.7s	594.7	 is if you turn the clock back in tissues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=597.7s	597.7	 those diseases go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=599.2s	599.2	 So aging is the problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=600.7s	600.7	 And instead, through most of the last 200 years,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=604.2s	604.2	 we've been sticking band-aids on diseases
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=606.2s	606.2	 that have already occurred because of aging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=608.6s	608.6	 and then it's too late.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=610.4s	610.4	 So there are a couple of things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=611.3s	611.3	 One is we wanna slow aging down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=612.6s	612.6	 so we don't get those diseases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=614.3s	614.3	 And when they do occur, don't just stick a band-aid on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=616.9s	616.9	 reverse the age of the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=618.1s	618.1	 and then the diseases will go away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=620.4s	620.4	 That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=623.5s	623.5	 Can we point to one specific general phenomenon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=627.3s	627.3	 in the body that underlies aging?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=630.1s	630.1	 Yeah, well, that's contentious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=631.9s	631.9	 because scientists like to come up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=633.7s	633.7	 with new hypotheses as it's how they build their careers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=637.3s	637.3	 But fortunately, during the 2000s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=639.9s	639.9	 we settled on eight or nine major causes of aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=643.6s	643.6	 We called them hallmarks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=644.6s	644.6	 because causes was a little bit too strong.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=647.3s	647.3	 But these eight or nine causes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=649.5s	649.5	 at least for the first time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=650.5s	650.5	 allowed us to come around and talk together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=653.6s	653.6	 We put them on a pizza
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=655.8s	655.8	 so everyone got an equal weighting, equal slices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=659.2s	659.2	 And but before that, by the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=660.6s	660.6	 we were trying to kill each other in the field.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=662.7s	662.7	 It was horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=663.8s	663.8	 Interesting that you guys work on aging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=665.4s	665.4	 and trying to kill each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=666.3s	666.3	 Yeah, isn't it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=667.1s	667.1	 Well, kill each other's careers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=668.9s	668.9	 I mean, I like to think I was fairly generous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=670.7s	670.7	 but I was one of the kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=672.0s	672.0	 and the old guard really didn't like the new guard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=674.3s	674.3	 We just came along in the 1990s and 90s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=676.6s	676.6	 and said, free radicals don't do much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=679.6s	679.6	 There were actually genes called longevity genes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=681.6s	681.6	 And that caused a whole ruckus.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=682.9s	682.9	 And there was this competition for what never happened,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=687.7s	687.7	 which was a Nobel prize for this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=689.7s	689.7	 And it just led to a lot of competition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=691.5s	691.5	 I would go to meetings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=693.5s	693.5	 and people would shout at each other and backstab.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=696.0s	696.0	 It was horrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=697.5s	697.5	 But then fortunately in the 2000s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=698.7s	698.7	 we rallied around this new map of aging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=701.9s	701.9	 with these causes or hallmarks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=704.4s	704.4	 But I think that there's one slice of the pizza
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=706.9s	706.9	 that is way larger than the others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=708.9s	708.9	 And we can get to that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=709.9s	709.9	 but that's the information in the cell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=712.2s	712.2	 that we call the epigenome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=715.1s	715.1	 Well, tell us a little bit more about the epigenome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=717.3s	717.3	 Frame it for us, if you will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=719.6s	719.6	 And then we'll get into ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=721.7s	721.7	 that one can adjust the epigenome in positive ways.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=725.5s	725.5	 Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=727.7s	727.7	 I'm a reductionist, is to boil it down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=730.2s	730.2	 And I actually ended up boiling aging down to an equation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=734.2s	734.2	 which is the loss of information due to entropy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=737.9s	737.9	 It's a hard thing to overcome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=738.9s	738.9	 the second law of thermodynamics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=740.5s	740.5	 That's fair.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=744.4s	744.4	 that I think aging is a loss of information
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=747.5s	747.5	 in the same way that when you Xerox something

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=763.5s	763.5	 There is the genetic information, which is digital,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=766.5s	766.5	 A, T, C, G, the chemical letters of DNA.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=771.7s	771.7	 that's just as important, it's essential, in fact,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=774.9s	774.9	 and that's the systems that control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=777.8s	777.8	 which genes are switched on and off,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=805.7s	805.7	 And in this other cell,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=806.5s	806.5	 we have to play a different set of songs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=817.6s	817.6	 they get messed up and they don't function well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=823.3s	823.3	 And these other hallmarks are largely manifestations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=827.6s	827.6	 Can we go a little deeper into what these scratches are?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=832.2s	832.2	 Is it the way that the DNA are packed into a cell?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=837.1s	837.1	 Is it the way that they're spaced?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=840.9s	840.9	 What are the scratches that you're referring to?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=846.7s	846.7	 If you join your chromosomes together,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=856.2s	856.2	 But it's not just wrapped up willy nilly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=885.5s	885.5	 Those little methyls will mark which songs get played

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=893.5s	893.5	 But in total, what we're saying is that the body
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=896.0s	896.0	 controls the genome through the ability to mark the DNA

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1032.3s	1032.3	 Very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1033.7s	1033.7	 So I started off in developmental neurobiology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1036.9s	1036.9	 So one of the things that I learned early on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1039.5s	1039.5	 that I still believe wholeheartedly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1042.7s	1042.7	 is that development doesn't stop at age 12 or 15 or even 25
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1049.4s	1049.4	 that your entire life is one long developmental arc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1055.1s	1055.1	 So in thinking about different portions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1057.3s	1057.3	 of that developmental arc, the early portion of infancy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1061.7s	1061.7	 and especially puberty seem like especially

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1069.8s	1069.8	 and kids in puberty and we think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1071.0s	1071.0	 oh, they're so vital, they're so young.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1073.9s	1073.9	 And yet the way you describe these changes in the epigenome
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1078.2s	1078.2	 and the way you have framed aging as a disease
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1081.1s	1081.1	 leads me to ask, are periods of immense vitality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1087.8s	1087.8	 the same periods when we're aging faster?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1091.4s	1091.4	 Yes, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1092.8s	1092.8	 And this is something I've never talked about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1095.1s	1095.1	 at least not publicly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1095.9s	1095.9	 So this is a really good question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1098.1s	1098.1	 So those chemicals we can measure,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1100.3s	1100.3	 it's also known as the Horvath Clock.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1102.9s	1102.9	 It's separate from your chronological age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1105.3s	1105.3	 So actually what I didn't mention is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1107.2s	1107.2	 when the AI looked at the faces of those people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1109.6s	1109.6	 they could predict their biological age, their internal age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1113.5s	1113.5	 So your skin represents the age of your organs as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1116.9s	1116.9	 And the people that look after themselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1118.6s	1118.6	 we can talk about how to do that later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1120.5s	1120.5	 But there are some people that are 10, 20 years younger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1122.9s	1122.9	 than other people biologically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1128.5s	1128.5	 or even before birth, if you look at animals,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1130.9s	1130.9	 there's a massive increase in age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1133.4s	1133.4	 based on that clock early in life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1136.0s	1136.0	 So you're right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1137.2s	1137.2	 So that's a really important point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 that you have accelerated aging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1140.5s	1140.5	 during the first few years of life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1142.1s	1142.1	 And then it goes linear towards the rest of your life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1145.5s	1145.5	 But there's another interesting thing you brought up,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1147.0s	1147.0	 which is that we're finding that the genes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1148.8s	1148.8	 that get messed up, that get scratched,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1153.1s	1153.1	 are those early developmental genes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1155.6s	1155.6	 They come on late in life and just mess up the system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1159.1s	1159.1	 And they seem to be particularly susceptible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1160.9s	1160.9	 to those scratches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1162.5s	1162.5	 So what's causing the scratches?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1164.3s	1164.3	 Well, we know of a couple of things in my lab
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1166.0s	1166.0	 we figured out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1166.9s	1166.9	 One is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1170.2s	1170.2	 particularly cuts to the DNA breaks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1172.4s	1172.4	 So if you have an X-ray or a cosmic ray,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1175.4s	1175.4	 or even if you go out in the sun
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1176.8s	1176.8	 and you'll get your broken chromosomes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1178.9s	1178.9	 that accelerates the unwinding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1181.5s	1181.5	 of those beautiful DNA loops that I mentioned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1186.5s	1186.5	 We can actually do this to a mouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1187.9s	1187.9	 We can accelerate that process
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1190.2s	1190.2	 and we get an old mouse, 50% older,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1192.5s	1192.5	 and it has this bent spine, kyphosis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1194.7s	1194.7	 it has gray hair, its organs are old.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1200.0s	1200.0	 The other thing that accelerates aging

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1209.1s	1209.1	 was accelerated as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1712.7s	1712.7	 well, two groups, one that was fed all the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1715.1s	1715.1	 or ate as much as they wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1717.3s	1717.3	 And the other group was only given food for an hour a day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1720.5s	1720.5	 And it turns out they ate roughly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1721.7s	1721.7	 the same amount of calories.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1724.4s	1724.4	 they're stuffing their faces.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1785.5s	1785.5	 that people struggle with the most

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1789.7s	1789.7	 this so-called intermittent fasting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1799.1s	1799.1	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1805.0s	1805.0	 because the supplements I have need to be dissolved in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1808.3s	1808.3	 And then I go throughout the whole day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1809.7s	1809.7	 as I'm doing right now here with this glass of water here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1813.9s	1813.9	 I'm just keeping myself filled with liquids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1815.9s	1815.9	 and so I don't feel hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1819.0s	1819.0	 Be aware that the first two to three weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1821.1s	1821.1	 when you try that, you will feel hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1822.9s	1822.9	 And you also have a habit of wanting to chew on something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1826.2s	1826.2	 There's a lot of physical parts to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1828.3s	1828.3	 But try to make it through the first three weeks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1830.2s	1830.2	 and do without breakfast or do without dinner
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1833.2s	1833.2	 and you'll get through it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1834.9s	1834.9	 And I did that for most of my life actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1838.3s	1838.3	 mainly because I wasn't hungry in the morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1840.7s	1840.7	 Some people are very hungry in the morning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1842.5s	1842.5	 and they may want to consider skipping dinner instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1845.3s	1845.3	 But I will go throughout the whole day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1847.1s	1847.1	 I don't get the crashes of the high glucose and the low glucose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1851.9s	1851.9	 Anyone who goes, oh man, it's three o'clock, I'm going to need to sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1855.3s	1855.3	 If you do what I do, you will not experience that anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1858.6s	1858.6	 Because what my body does is it regulates blood sugar levels naturally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1862.9s	1862.9	 My liver is putting out glucose when it needs to and it's very steady
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1866.6s	1866.6	 and gives me pure focus throughout the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1868.3s	1868.3	 And I don't even have to think about lunch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1870.1s	1870.1	 I'm just powering through.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1871.8s	1871.8	 At dinner, I love food as much as anybody.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1874.7s	1874.7	 So I will eat a regular, pretty healthy meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1878.6s	1878.6	 I'll try to eat mostly vegetables.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1880.7s	1880.7	 I can eat some fish, some shrimp.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1883.4s	1883.4	 I rarely will eat a steak.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1889.3s	1889.3	 Now, if I eat a steak, it will not get digested very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1892.1s	1892.1	 I'll feel terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1893.9s	1893.9	 If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1895.7s	1895.7	 Well, we...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1899.8s	1899.8	 Well, everybody's different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1901.0s	1901.0	 I mean, that's the other thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1902.0s	1902.0	 What works for me may not be perfect for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1903.9s	1903.9	 And we do have to measure things to know what's working.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1907.7s	1907.7	 I rarely eat dessert.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1908.9s	1908.9	 I gave up dessert and sugar when I turned 40.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1913.2s	1913.2	 And occasionally I'll steal a bit of dessert because it doesn't hurt if you steal it, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1917.9s	1917.9	 But other than that, I avoid sugar, which includes simple carbohydrates.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1923.3s	1923.3	 Bread, I try to avoid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1925.0s	1925.0	 I've actually noticed this is just a side note.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1928.1s	1928.1	 I used to get build up of plaque pretty easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1930.2s	1930.2	 And every time I went to the dentist, they'd have to scrape it off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1932.2s	1932.2	 And I even bought tools to scrape it off because it was driving me nuts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1935.8s	1935.8	 I don't get plaque anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1937.0s	1937.0	 And I think it's because of my diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1938.9s	1938.9	 I don't have those sugars in my mouth that the bacteria feed on and then form the biofilm on the teeth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1944.1s	1944.1	 Much better breath, by the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1946.5s	1946.5	 Oh, that's a benefit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1948.5s	1948.5	 So do you ever fast longer than this?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1951.6s	1951.6	 It sounds like if you go to bed, well, you tend to stay up late, I know, because I get texts from you at like two in the morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1960.7s	1960.7	 My time, which means you're up very late and up early as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1963.9s	1963.9	 But assuming that people go to sleep sometime around 11, 30 or 12 plus or minus an hour and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1972.2s	1972.2	 Plus or minus 90 minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1975.9s	1975.9	 You're eating more or less on a it sounds like a some like 20 hours of fasting, four hours of eating or 16 hours of fasting and eight hours of food intake, etc.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1986.0s	1986.0	 But do you ever do longer fasts like 48 hours or 72 hours a week long fasts?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1991.4s	1991.4	 Occasionally I do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1993.5s	1993.5	 So my typical day, I would only eat within a two hour window.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1996.3s	1996.3	 Just usually I'm either eating out or.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=1998.9s	1998.9	 So you're 22, too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2000.1s	2000.1	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2001.3s	2001.3	 Yeah, I love well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2003.1s	2003.1	 And if you exercise, do you feel like then you just power through and maintain that fasted state?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2007.8s	2007.8	 Absolutely. I can exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2009.3s	2009.3	 And now my body's so used to it, I don't feel like I need food after exercising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2012.8s	2012.8	 I used to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2014.1s	2014.1	 And but have I gone longer?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2016.5s	2016.5	 Yes, but not very often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2018.0s	2018.0	 I find it quite difficult to go more than 24 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2022.3s	2022.3	 But when I do it, maybe it's once a month, I'll go for two days after two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2027.0s	2027.0	 And actually, even better if you go for three days without eating, it kicks in even greater longevity benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2035.0s	2035.0	 So there's a system called the autophagy system, which digests old and misfolded proteins in the body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2041.6s	2041.6	 And there's a natural cleansing that happens when you're hungry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2044.8s	2044.8	 Macro autophagy, its name is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2046.7s	2046.7	 But a good friend of mine, Anna Maria Cuervo at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2051.1s	2051.1	 discovered a deep cleanse called the chaperone mediated autophagy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2054.9s	2054.9	 which kicks in day two, day three, which really gets rid of the deep proteins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2061.7s	2061.7	 And what excites me is she just put out a big paper that said, if you trigger this process in an old mouse, it lives 35 percent longer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2071.1s	2071.1	 Wow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2071.6s	2071.6	 Yeah. So it's a big deal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2072.9s	2072.9	 If I could go longer, I would.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2074.5s	2074.5	 But I just find that with my lifestyle and I'm going always day 110 percent, I need to eat at least once a day, unfortunately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2082.9s	2082.9	 One more practical question than a mechanistic question related to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2086.1s	2086.1	 The practical question is when you are fasting, regardless of how long, I know you're ingesting fluids like water and presumably some caffeine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2094.3s	2094.3	 I heard you had several or more or more espresso today, which is impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2101.6s	2101.6	 But are you also ingesting electrolytes?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2105.1s	2105.1	 I know some people get lightheaded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2106.5s	2106.5	 They start to feel shaky when they fast and that the addition of sodium to their water or potassium,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2112.8s	2112.8	 magnesium is something that's becoming a little more in vogue now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2116.1s	2116.1	 Is that something that you do or that you see a need for people to do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2119.4s	2119.4	 Well, it makes sense. But I haven't had a need to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2123.5s	2123.5	 So I don't. I just I drink tea during the day and coffee when I'm first awake and I don't get the shakes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2129.9s	2129.9	 You know, I don't fix what's not broken.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2133.1s	2133.1	 And I do add things to my protocol that I think will improve me and avoid those things, of course, that won't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2140.7s	2140.7	 But yeah, because I don't have a need for it, I don't try it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2143.3s	2143.3	 But it does make sense, especially if you've had a big night the night before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2147.2s	2147.2	 You probably want to supplement with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2149.1s	2149.1	 But I think there's there's a fair amount of good stuff in tea and coffee as it is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2154.5s	2154.5	 OK, so then the mechanistic question is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2158.4s	2158.4	 You've told us that there's ample evidence that keeping your blood sugar low for a period of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2163.9s	2163.9	 24 hours can help trigger some of these pro longevity anti-aging mechanisms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2170.9s	2170.9	 and that extending them out two or three days can trigger yet additional mechanisms of of gobbling up of of dead cells and things of that sort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2181.1s	2181.1	 How is it that blood glucose triggers these mechanisms?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2185.7s	2185.7	 Because we've said, OK, remove glucose and things get better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2189.1s	2189.1	 You've talked before, maybe we could talk more now about some of the underlying cellular and genetic mechanisms, things like the sirtuins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2196.1s	2196.1	 But how are glucose and the sirtuins actually tethered to one another mechanistically?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2201.2s	2201.2	 There's a really good question that proves you're a scientist or the world leading one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2207.3s	2207.3	 So what we what we now know is that these longevity pathways, we call them these longevity genes talk to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2214.2s	2214.2	 And we used to say, oh, my longevity genes more important than yours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2216.9s	2216.9	 It was ridiculous because they're all talking to each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2219.1s	2219.1	 You pull one lever and the other one moves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2221.6s	2221.6	 And the way to think of it is that there are systems set up to detect what you're eating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2225.5s	2225.5	 So the sirtuins will mainly respond to sugar and insulin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2230.9s	2230.9	 And then there's this other system called mTOR, which is sensing how much protein or amino acids are coming into your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2238.6s	2238.6	 And they talk to each other. We can pull one and affect the other and vice versa.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2242.5s	2242.5	 But together, when you're fasting, you'll get the sirtuin activation, which is good for you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2248.9s	2248.9	 And you'll also through lack of amino acids, particularly three of them, leucine, isoleucine, valine, the body will down regulate mTOR.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2257.4s	2257.4	 And it's that ups or to and down mTOR that is hugely beneficial and turns on all of the body's defenses, the pro chewing up the old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity, giving us more energy, repairing cells, all of that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2271.6s	2271.6	 And so these two pathways, I think, are the most important for longevity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2275.2s	2275.2	 So interesting. You mentioned leucine within the resistance training slash bodybuilding slash fitness community.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2282.9s	2282.9	 Leucine gets a lot of attention because there are longstanding debates about how much protein one needs per day and how much one can assimilate at each meal.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2290.7s	2290.7	 It makes for many YouTube videos and not much else, frankly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2295.7s	2295.7	 However, it's clear that because of leucine's effects on the mTOR pathway, that there are many people, not just people in these particular fitness communities that are actively trying to ingest more leucine on a regular basis in order to maximize their wellness and fitness and in some cases, muscle growth, but also just wellness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2316.7s	2316.7	 But what I interpret your last statement to mean is that leucine, because it triggers cellar growth, is actually pro aging in some sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2326.5s	2326.5	 Is that right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2328.0s	2328.0	 Well, it could be. That's that's what the evidence suggests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2330.4s	2330.4	 And again, it goes back to the debate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2332.3s	2332.3	 Should you supplement with growth hormone or testosterone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2336.5s	2336.5	 All of these activities will give you immediate benefits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2340.1s	2340.1	 You'll you'll bulk up more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2342.0s	2342.0	 You'll feel better immediately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2344.3s	2344.3	 But based on the research, it's at the expense of long term health.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2348.5s	2348.5	 So my view of longevity, the way I treat my body is I don't burn both candles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2355.1s	2355.1	 I have one end of the candle lit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2357.2s	2357.2	 I'm very careful. I don't blow on it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2359.8s	2359.8	 But I also do enough exercise that I'm building up my muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2363.2s	2363.2	 But I'm not huge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2364.4s	2364.4	 Anyone who's seen me knows that I'm not a professional bodybuilder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2369.3s	2369.3	 But I tried to actually is the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2371.7s	2371.7	 And I haven't said this publicly that I can remember.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2374.3s	2374.3	 I pulse things so that I get periods of fasting and then I eat and I take a supplement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2381.4s	2381.4	 Then I fast, then I exercise and I'm taking the supplements and eating in the right timing to allow me to build up muscle sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2390.9s	2390.9	 because you can't just expect to take something constantly and do something constantly for it to work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2397.5s	2397.5	 And that's that's why it's taken me about 15 years to develop my protocol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2400.9s	2400.9	 And there's a lot of subtlety to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2402.9s	2402.9	 It sounds like a very rational protocol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2404.9s	2404.9	 Does the name Ori Hoffmeckler mean anything to you?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2407.7s	2407.7	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2408.3s	2408.3	 OK, just briefly, I discovered Ori Hoffmeckler about 15 years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2414.6s	2414.6	 He was a in Israeli special forces.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2416.8s	2416.8	 He's now got to be close to 70.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2419.1s	2419.1	 Forgive me, Ori, if that's that that number is inflated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2423.5s	2423.5	 He wrote a book called The Warrior Diet, which got very little attention at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2428.3s	2428.3	 But what he said was when he was in Israeli special forces, they rarely ate more than once per day and sometimes once every second or third day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2436.9s	2436.9	 And this is a guy who maintains an incredible physical stature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2441.5s	2441.5	 He's very lean, very strong and very vital at, you know, I wouldn't say an advanced age,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2448.1s	2448.1	 but he's getting up there and he just seems to be getting better and better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2451.5s	2451.5	 Ori Hoffmeckler was the person who essentially founded, if you will, although our ancestors found it, to be completely fair, the so-called intermittent fasting diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2463.5s	2463.5	 He called it the warrior diet. And this book didn't get much attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2466.1s	2466.1	 But one of the things that you just said really reminded me of Ori, I sat down with him, I actually went to his home and sat down with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2472.9s	2472.9	 And he said, fasting is wonderful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2475.3s	2475.3	 But these pulses where you nourish the body or even slightly overnourish the body, provided they aren't too frequent, have a tremendous effect on vitality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2486.1s	2486.1	 And so I want to use that as kind of a segue to address this issue of vitality versus longevity, because here you're telling me and certainly the evidence supports that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2498.2s	2498.2	 you know, growth hormone will make you feel better and younger taking testosterone or estrogen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2502.3s	2502.3	 We should probably say there are women who take hormone therapies later in life who take estrogen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2507.9s	2507.9	 They experience a strong increase in vitality if it's done correctly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2512.2s	2512.2	 But there is an effect of aging the body more rapidly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2516.5s	2516.5	 It's sort of a second puberty, if you will.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2519.4s	2519.4	 But this idea of restriction and then pulsing, not necessarily feast and famine, but certainly famine and feast in lowercase letters, there really seems to be something about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2531.0s	2531.0	 So at a cellular level, like we kind of go back to mTOR and the sirtuins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2536.9s	2536.9	 how do you think that the cells might be reacting to this kind of lowercase feast and uppercase famine type protocol?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2548.1s	2548.1	 All right. Well, the the pulsing, I think, is what you want to do is to get the cells to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2557.1s	2557.1	 Perceiving adversity, because our modern life, we're sitting around, we're eating too much, we're not exercising.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2565.6s	2565.6	 Our cells respond, they go, hey, everything's cool, no problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2569.4s	2569.4	 And they become relaxed and they don't turn on their defenses and we age rapidly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2573.2s	2573.2	 We can see it in the clock. People who exercise and eat less have a slower ticking clock.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2578.3s	2578.3	 It's a fact. But my protocol is different than most people's because I am pulsing it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2585.5s	2585.5	 Now, first of all, let's get to why did I even think that might be possible?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2589.1s	2589.1	 Because I didn't read the Warrior Diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2591.9s	2591.9	 What I found in my research was that if we gave resveratrol, this red wine molecule that became well known in the 2000s,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2602.1s	2602.1	 if we gave it to mice their whole lifespan, they were protected against a high fat diet, which we call the Western diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2609.0s	2609.0	 They had lean organs. They live slightly longer, but not a lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2620.4s	2620.4	 So resveratrol protected them against the high fat diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2623.3s	2623.3	 We gave it to them on a normal diet. They just ate it when they wanted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2626.3s	2626.3	 And there wasn't much effect.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2628.4s	2628.4	 This is what's not known, though it's in the supplemental data of the paper that nobody ever reads.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2634.0s	2634.0	 The mice that we give in resveratrol every second day on a normal diet live dramatically longer than any other group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2642.4s	2642.4	 So people out there, you know, my critics say, resveratrol didn't extend the lifespan of mice on a normal diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2648.6s	2648.6	 Therefore, it's not aging. It's just protecting against a high fat diet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2652.6s	2652.6	 Well, look at the supplemental data, please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2655.1s	2655.1	 If you give it to the mice every other day, we had mice living over three years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2659.8s	2659.8	 Wow, that's a long time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2661.5s	2661.5	 I have got many, many mice in my ownership and my lab at Stanford, and that's a very long life for a mouse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2669.5s	2669.5	 It was by far. And so it was a long lifespan extension.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2673.8s	2673.8	 And what that told me is that probably you don't want to be taking a supplement every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2680.2s	2680.2	 You can take it either every other day or give your body a rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2683.5s	2683.5	 And I do the same with my meals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2685.3s	2685.3	 I rest during the day and then I give a nutritious dinner to my body and then give it a rest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2690.7s	2690.7	 Same with exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2699.1s	2699.1	 For those of you who don't know, metformin is a drug given to type 2 diabetics to bring down their blood sugar levels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2704.2s	2704.2	 But it's been found that looking at tens of thousands of veterans and others,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2708.3s	2708.3	 that those two type 2 diabetics live longer than people that don't even get type 2 diabetes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2712.2s	2712.2	 So it's a longevity drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2714.7s	2714.7	 Right now, you have to get it from your doctor in the US.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2717.5s	2717.5	 In most other countries, you can just get it over the counter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2726.3s	2726.3	 Cancer, heart disease, frailty, what else? Dementia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2734.5s	2734.5	 In addition, you take metformin and you're fasting each day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2737.9s	2737.9	 So when do you take it relative to the fasting?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2739.8s	2739.8	 Yeah, I always take metformin in the morning, along with the resveratrol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2746.3s	2746.3	 because, for a number of reasons, but mainly because my body responds better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2752.7s	2752.7	 And I've been measuring my body for 12, 13 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2756.3s	2756.3	 But here's the thing, if I'm going to exercise that day, I will skip the metformin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2761.9s	2761.9	 And a lot of people who do pay attention to this kind of thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2766.2s	2766.2	 think that they should stop taking metformin because they're never going to get muscle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2769.4s	2769.4	 or it's going to affect their ability to build up muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2773.1s	2773.1	 But that's not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2775.1s	2775.1	 What metformin does to you, it actually just reduces your ability to have stamina,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2780.4s	2780.4	 because it's inhibiting your body's ability to make energy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2783.1s	2783.1	 And so what happens is, when you're on metformin, you do fewer reps.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2787.5s	2787.5	 But guess what? Those muscles that you do build up on metformin have the same strength
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2792.3s	2792.3	 and have much lower inflammation and other markers of aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2796.4s	2796.4	 You just won't have that extra 5% size of muscles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2800.4s	2800.4	 So if you want large muscles, don't take metformin and you'll be fine during your exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2806.7s	2806.7	 But for me, I'm not trying to get giant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2808.8s	2808.8	 I'm not trying to get giant.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2822.6s	2822.6	 But sometimes in scientific literature, it's worth bringing this up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2826.6s	2826.6	 If there's a 5% difference in a graph, then either the press release or some reporter will say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2833.4s	2833.4	 oh my goodness, big difference, 5% can't take metformin during exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2837.7s	2837.7	 That's the headline.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2841.4s	2841.4	 And the graph is distorted because they've changed the axes to make it look bigger.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2846.0s	2846.0	 And now it's become a myth that metformin greatly inhibits your ability to exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2851.1s	2851.1	 which is not true.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2852.7s	2852.7	 But in an abundance of caution, I skip my metformin on days I'm going to exercise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2857.3s	2857.3	 And not only that, I'm one of the 20% of people that has a stomach sensitivity to it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2865.4s	2865.4	 You mentioned metformin is available only by prescription from a doctor, at least in the US.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2889.5s	2889.5	 and not feel as if you've eaten enormous quantities of food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2901.5s	2901.5	 to metformin, works on the AMPK pathway and the mTOR pathway, et cetera,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2934.5s	2934.5	 timing of low blood sugar and these sorts of things?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2942.0s	2942.0	 It's often known as the poor man's metformin.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=2951.6s	2951.6	 It is effective at boosting energetics in the body, just like AMPK and metformin does.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3668.4s	3668.4	 and won't that just force the body to make NAD?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3671.9s	3671.9	 And the answer is no, it doesn't work very well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3674.7s	3674.7	 We know this just by doing the experiment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3682.6s	3682.6	 but relative to vitamin B3, it's big.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3685.5s	3685.5	 It's got those phosphates on there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3687.5s	3687.5	 It's got a sugar.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3693.2s	3693.2	 So you've got all these components that come together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3695.5s	3695.5	 to make this very complicated little molecule called NAD.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3703.5s	3703.5	 that the body needs to make NAD.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3705.5s	3705.5	 If you give NR or just vitamin B3, which is an even smaller molecule,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3709.9s	3709.9	 the body has to find these other components from somewhere else.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3715.1s	3715.1	 Well, the body needs it for DNA, needs it for bones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3718.4s	3718.4	 So high doses of something that requires additional phosphate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3723.4s	3723.4	 makes me a little concerned.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3725.3s	3725.3	 And we have compared NMN and NR head to head in mouse studies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3741.1s	3741.1	 I see.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3747.3s	3747.3	 to increase my NAD levels and presumably slow my aging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3753.7s	3753.7	 how much NMN should I take?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3755.2s	3755.2	 What's the protocol that you do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3759.1s	3759.1	 And are the various forms that are out there, are some better or some worse?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3765.6s	3765.6	 Well, I'm always happy to tell you what I do and what my father does.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3768.6s	3768.6	 My 82-year-old father, we take a gram of NMN every day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3772.8s	3772.8	 So it's a gram of resveratrol and a gram of NMN.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3776.0s	3776.0	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3776.6s	3776.6	 Okay. A thousand milligrams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3778.0s	3778.0	 Now, another important point, which is I'm not the same as everybody else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3784.8s	3784.8	 I have a different microbiome, age, sex, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3790.6s	3790.6	 And so I know if something's, or I think I know if something's making me better or worse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3794.6s	3794.6	 based on measuring 45 different things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3805.0s	3805.0	 But I have studied, as I said, dozens of people who take NMN at a gram, sometimes two grams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3812.2s	3812.2	 And I know by looking at all those people that without any exceptions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3816.8s	3816.8	 that if you do what I do, your NAD levels go up by about twofold or more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3822.3s	3822.3	 And so I do that every day, the thousand milligrams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3824.4s	3824.4	 Now, people sell it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3825.6s	3825.6	 Now, I never get into brands and all that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3846.4s	3846.4	 let's say you want to buy NMN, look for a company that is well established,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3850.7s	3850.7	 that has high levels of quality control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3853.8s	3853.8	 Look for three letters, GMP, which is good manufacturing practices.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3859.0s	3859.0	 And so that means they make it under a certain level of quality control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3862.1s	3862.1	 You're not going to find iron filings in there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3870.0s	3870.0	 But so that's all I can say right now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3872.4s	3872.4	 I'm working on something that's going to be much more helpful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3893.4s	3893.4	 Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3896.0s	3896.0	 or do you take it spread throughout the day?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=3898.5s	3898.5	 It's all in the morning for those things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4620.9s	4620.9	 Is that how it works?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4631.0s	4631.0	 So I pull that up on the screen and I'm showing him the changes in my cholesterol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4636.8s	4636.8	 in my CRP, which is an inflammatory marker as you know, and we're going through it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4645.1s	4645.1	 slightly out of the optimal range for me, which is different than what he would do, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4649.9s	4649.9	 But what was funny is that he says, this is great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4653.0s	4653.0	 I love this data, but I'm not allowed to get this because, of course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4657.1s	4657.1	 the insurance companies won't pay for it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4661.8s	4661.8	 It's not super expensive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4663.0s	4663.0	 I would say if you save a bit of money on a coffee, you can afford this kind of stuff.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4670.2s	4670.2	 But the main point is that doctors do like this data.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4673.5s	4673.5	 It's just that they're unable to spend the money on every one of their patients to get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4678.0s	4678.0	 Is there a code word that someone can use with their physician that will trigger

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4704.2s	4704.2	 I'd love to have blood work repeatedly over time, but that's hard to get for financial reasons.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4813.5s	4813.5	 but there's enough data that I would say if you have high levels of CRP, you need to get your
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4818.3s	4818.3	 levels down quickly. And the levels usually go up with age and with levels of inflammation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4830.1s	4830.1	 You'll find it will come down. There are also drugs that can do it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=4916.9s	4916.9	 shows that anorexics, people that essentially eat no food unless you force them to,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5525.2s	5525.2	 we showed it in yeast and worms and flies and mice. Before that, it was thought that resveratrol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5549.7s	5549.7	 make it not an antioxidant, guess what, it still worked fine. So it wasn't its antioxidant activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5555.4s	5555.4	 that was extending lifespan, it was its ability to turn on the yeast's defenses against aging.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5575.5s	5575.5	 which is that what's so wonderful about science is that because the goal is mechanism, you can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5581.6s	5581.6	 really start to understand as you just described what actually mediates a process is very different

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5653.9s	5653.9	 training, these sorts of things. Um, in other words, what are the sorts of things that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5658.0s	5658.0	 can do to improve the sirtuin pathway? And I, I realized that they're caveats. We can't go

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5852.0s	5852.0	 about it. At a year of age, a mouse gets infertile female mouse due to, due to fasting or due to,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5958.4s	5958.4	 after a certain point, the critical period shuts down, essentially the brain can't change or not
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5962.7s	5962.7	 nearly as, as much. And then people came along later and showed that you could open up these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5967.3s	5967.3	 critical periods again, but very briefly. And it takes a very specific stimulus, essentially high

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=5980.6s	5980.6	 if you take an animal and to some degree, this has been shown in humans as well, and you let them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6457.9s	6457.9	 you have to burn energy. It may be only slightly, but over the whole night, if you're a little bit

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6483.6s	6483.6	 compensate with changes in my diet and exercise until I get back into it. You reminded me of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6488.4s	6488.4	 something that I meant to ask earlier, that obesity reduces NAD levels and accelerates aging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6495.3s	6495.3	 How? I mean, okay, so again, this is the scientist in us, you know, so someone's carrying a lot of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6502.6s	6502.6	 excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and visceral fat. But why should that reduce NAD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6511.0s	6511.0	 in any ways that are independent of effects on glucose and insulin? If, you know, is there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6515.7s	6515.7	 something direct about white adipose tissue? And the reason I ask this is not simply to dig into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6521.8s	6521.8	 mechanism alone, but I think there are really interesting data now that fat actually gets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6526.4s	6526.4	 neural innervation. I mean, it's not just stored fuel. It's stored fuel that's acting as an endocrine

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6541.4s	6541.4	 Yeah, that's a question that is so obvious, but so few people ask it. That's what makes you a good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6553.9s	6553.9	 comes along with a lot of problems that include a lot of senescent cells in fat. If you stain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6561.0s	6561.0	 old fat for senescent cells, it lights up. And when you kill off those cells, at least in mice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6567.2s	6567.2	 and maybe in humans, it looks like the fat is less toxic to the body, because those senescent cells
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6573.1s	6573.1	 in the fat are secreting these inflammatory molecules that will accelerate aging as we now know.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6587.6s	6587.6	 the sirtuins only like to come on or get activated when the body needs, is under adversity. And if

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6607.4s	6607.4	 could have something to do with the response to glucose, which then responds to the sirtuin gene.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6613.2s	6613.2	 But that hasn't been worked out very well. And there's, is there any evidence that leptin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9IxomBusuw&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=83&pp=iAQB&t=6616.8s	6616.8	 this hormone from fat can actually interact with the sirtuin pathway? I don't recall seeing that.
