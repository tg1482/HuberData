https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=527.6s	527.6	 why were they all able to be so focused?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=746.2s	746.2	 And this phase one of our circadian cycle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=748.4s	748.4	 is when we are best at doing analytic detail type work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=753.8s	753.8	 of workspace optimization that are important for phase one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=778.2s	778.2	 to happen too late in the day.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=784.4s	784.4	 So one of the things that I've done for my workspace
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=787.0s	787.0	 is to make sure that when I wake up in the morning,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=789.1s	789.1	 I do go get my sunlight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=797.4s	797.4	 But once I set out to do some work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=799.5s	799.5	 that all the overhead lights in that room are on,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=807.2s	807.2	 and further release of these neuromodulators

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=814.3s	814.3	 could be a very low cost way of having, for instance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=816.4s	816.4	 a desk lamp and those overhead lights.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=823.5s	823.5	 which is, I think those are mainly made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=825.2s	825.2	 for people doing selfie type videos,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=829.8s	829.8	 Ring lights can be pretty cost effective.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=834.0s	834.0	 and they have the sort of bright blue light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=835.9s	835.9	 that is going to optimally stimulate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=838.0s	838.0	 those melanopsin ganglion cells.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=842.2s	842.2	 or a bright LED on their desk in front of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=844.7s	844.7	 And indeed I have one of these.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=852.3s	852.3	 I can mention the brand, but again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=853.6s	853.6	 I have no financial affiliation to them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1321.6s	1321.6	 for 90 minutes at least.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1358.0s	1358.0	 and remain awake in the middle of the night

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1378.2s	1378.2	 like caffeine or even more aggressive stimulants.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1650.2s	1650.2	 Whereas when you look straight ahead,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1651.7s	1651.7	 or in particular, when you look up,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1658.3s	1658.3	 when we get sleepy, our eyelids tend to close

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1714.6s	1714.6	 and starts to feel sleepy or simply unfocused,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1717.7s	1717.7	 unable to attend to whatever it is that you're doing,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1734.9s	1734.9	 or your laptop or other computer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1745.1s	1745.1	 I've long just used a stack of books

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1749.2s	1749.2	 and turn it upside down and set it there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1750.8s	1750.8	 I do use a mixed standing seated desk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1752.8s	1752.8	 I'll talk about that in a few minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1756.3s	1756.3	 You could wall mount a monitor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1763.4s	1763.4	 Some people though will configure a second screen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1765.8s	1765.8	 You have to decide what's right for you and your budget.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1779.8s	1779.8	 Oh, that would be pretty cool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1782.3s	1782.3	 But you do want it above you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1784.3s	1784.3	 Now there are a couple of solutions to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1786.2s	1786.2	 that don't involve a wall mount or stacking books or boxes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1790.0s	1790.0	 For instance, you could be one of those people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1792.1s	1792.1	 that likes to lie in bed or on the sofa

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1795.9s	1795.9	 by putting pillows on your knees.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1812.5s	1812.5	 But in terms of lying down on the couch,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1815.4s	1815.4	 it is somewhat easier to get that screen up above you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1818.2s	1818.2	 You can kind of slide underneath that screen and get typing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1820.9s	1820.9	 But there's a problem with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1822.2s	1822.2	 And we'll talk about this a little bit more in a moment,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=1945.1s	1945.1	 to sit up straight or even better, to stand up straight.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2394.9s	2394.9	 look at a screen that's very, very big

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2432.0s	2432.0	 so that they're not looking off into the periphery.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2440.1s	2440.1	 They mostly see in panorama, in magnocellar vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2444.0s	2444.0	 And so those blinders are designed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2445.5s	2445.5	 to keep their visual focus straight ahead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2447.2s	2447.2	 So they physically restrict it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2449.1s	2449.1	 Now, some people will actually go to lengths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2452.2s	2452.2	 to further restrict their visual focus.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=2483.4s	2483.4	 Make sure that whatever you're looking at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2pc6NwsHQ&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=78&pp=iAQB&t=5256.3s	5256.3	 However, verbal memory scores actually got worse
