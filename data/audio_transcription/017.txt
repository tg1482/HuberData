https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=41.6s	41.6	 is called the physiological sigh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=43.8s	43.8	 A physiological sigh is a pattern of breathing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=46.1s	46.1	 that involves two inhales followed by an extended exhale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=49.6s	49.6	 Physiological sighs were discovered in the 1930s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 as a pattern of breathing that people go into spontaneously

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=61.2s	61.2	 of a gas called carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=64.2s	64.2	 Carbon dioxide triggers the impulse to breathe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=67.1s	67.1	 There are neurons in the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 that know when carbon dioxide levels have gotten too high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=71.1s	71.1	 And when the levels get too high,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=72.6s	72.6	 they trigger inhale and exhale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=74.8s	74.8	 or double inhale and exhale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=77.2s	77.2	 Now you can do physiological sighs voluntarily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=80.5s	80.5	 anytime you're feeling too stressed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=82.0s	82.0	 and you want to feel more calm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=83.9s	83.9	 You do it like this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=85.0s	85.0	 So it's a double inhale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=90.4s	90.4	 And typically the first inhale is longer than the second,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=93.0s	93.0	 but the second one is still important to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=94.9s	94.9	 And then a very long extended exhale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=97.1s	97.1	 Typically both inhales are through the nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=99.1s	99.1	 and the exhale is through the mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=100.7s	100.7	 That's the most effective way to do the physiological sigh.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=103.6s	103.6	 However, you can't breathe through your nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=105.4s	105.4	 or your mouth for whatever reason,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=106.9s	106.9	 do it all through your mouth or all through your nose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=109.3s	109.3	 The second inhale is really important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=111.2s	111.2	 because your lungs are not just two big bags of air,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=114.6s	114.6	 they're two big bags of air with lots of little sacks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=117.3s	117.3	 millions of sacks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=120.3s	120.3	 their volume is as big as a tennis court.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=122.3s	122.3	 And that allows both the intake of more oxygen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=125.2s	125.2	 but also the offload of carbon dioxide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=128.3s	128.3	 So when you do the double inhale,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=130.3s	130.3	 it reinflates any of these little sacks that have collapsed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=133.5s	133.5	 And in doing so, it allows you to offload
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=135.2s	135.2	 more carbon dioxide.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=137.0s	137.0	 So if you're feeling stressed in any circumstance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=140.0s	140.0	 inhale twice through the nose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=141.8s	141.8	 and then exhale long through the mouth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=144.1s	144.1	 If you want, you can repeat it a second
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=145.8s	145.8	 or even a third time, but typically just one or two,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=149.4s	149.4	 maybe three physiological sighs are sufficient
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=151.9s	151.9	 to bring your level of stress and alertness down very fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=121&pp=iAQB&t=155.6s	155.6	 and allow you to feel more calm.
