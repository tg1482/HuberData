https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=1670.2s	1670.2	 which was published in BMC Medicine,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=1705.8s	1705.8	 We need to define some of the parameters around sauna,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=1729.9s	1729.9	 are between 80 degrees Celsius,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2466.3s	2466.3	 I'll just briefly describe the protocol they used.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2469.2s	2469.2	 They had these men attend four sauna sessions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2475.8s	2475.8	 12 minutes, the temperature of those saunas

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2484.2s	2484.2	 admittedly not in my head.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2493.8s	2493.8	 during which they did get into some cool water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2496.6s	2496.6	 or cold water of about 10 degrees,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2506.1s	2506.1	 throughout this study, before, during and after.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2514.0s	2514.0	 They looked at prolactin and they looked at cortisol.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2527.3s	2527.3	 cortisol levels tend to increase dramatically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2533.9s	2533.9	 each day, right about the time of waking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2535.9s	2535.9	 and specifically right about the time of waking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2537.6s	2537.6	 is actually beneficial for our alertness and our energy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2543.3s	2543.3	 is a good thing provided it happens early in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2546.5s	2546.5	 Late day increases in cortisol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2579.1s	2579.1	 for extended periods of time,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2594.6s	2594.6	 They're, for one reason or another,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2596.7s	2596.7	 they're subjected to many, too many stressors

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2609.1s	2609.1	 to 90-degree environment, that's again, 90 degrees Celsius,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2620.3s	2620.3	 I can imagine that you could also just take a cool shower
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2622.6s	2622.6	 or a cold shower afterwards.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2627.1s	2627.1	 So there you have a tool.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2628.6s	2628.6	 But it's not a completely zero-cost tool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2630.2s	2630.2	 because you need to heat the water
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2631.2s	2631.2	 and you need to have access to hot and cold water,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2633.0s	2633.0	 at least hot and cold contrast of some sort.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=2672.6s	2672.6	 I think this is a very interesting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4039.8s	4039.8	 And then if you're feeling really bold

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4045.8s	4045.8	 in one day stimulus every once in a while.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4064.7s	4064.7	 whether or not you want to do it regularly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4078.2s	4078.2	 and I've been using a protocol for a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4080.1s	4080.1	 that involves trying, meaning I accomplish this most weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4083.5s	4083.5	 not all, trying to get into a sauna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4086.4s	4086.4	 for three 20 minute sessions every week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4090.1s	4090.1	 I use a dry sauna, so it's not a steam room.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4093.3s	4093.3	 If I don't have access to it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4094.4s	4094.4	 I might take a hot bath or something of that sort.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4096.2s	4096.2	 But in general,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4097.1s	4097.1	 I just stick to doing the sauna three times a week.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4103.4s	4103.4	 either a cardiovascular workout or a weight workout,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4108.3s	4108.3	 Why later in the evening?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4113.1s	4113.1	 that we all experience.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4117.6s	4117.6	 and the episodes related to sleep,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4122.3s	4122.3	 Every early morning,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4127.6s	4127.6	 your body temperature is at its all time lowest, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4131.2s	4131.2	 We call that your temperature minimum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4133.2s	4133.2	 Right about waking, your body temperature increases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4135.4s	4135.4	 In fact, an increase in body temperature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4136.9s	4136.9	 is part of the reason you wake up at all,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4139.3s	4139.3	 unless of course you're setting an alarm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4142.6s	4142.6	 Increases in body temperature are going to be

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4150.2s	4150.2	 to increase through the morning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4151.6s	4151.6	 You'll get that increase in cortisol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4153.0s	4153.0	 that's a healthy increase in cortisol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4154.9s	4154.9	 Body temperature will increase into the afternoon

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4160.2s	4160.2	 This general contour can be shifted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4162.2s	4162.2	 by whether or not you exercise, how often you eat,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4170.6s	4170.6	 but it's not really that significant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4173.0s	4173.0	 to throw off this general contour and rhythm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4178.0s	4178.0	 most days, depending on time of year,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4182.7s	4182.7	 And as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4185.3s	4185.3	 and here I'm referring to your core body temperature,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4187.1s	4187.1	 not your shell body temperature,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4200.0s	4200.0	 Okay, what that means is that when you decide to do sauna
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQ3GjpGq5Y8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=66&pp=iAQB&t=4204.6s	4204.6	 or cold exposure for that matter is going to be important.
