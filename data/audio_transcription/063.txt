https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=800.6s	800.6	 So he was teaching Frieda von Reichman hypnosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=803.7s	803.7	 and he just kept doing it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=806.4s	806.4	 that he was getting better results

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=816.6s	816.6	 And so the dinner table conversations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=818.3s	818.3	 were pretty interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=822.5s	822.5	 I would get to watch that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=828.0s	828.0	 I figured I'll take a course.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=868.1s	868.1	 So I said, you want to learn a breathing exercise?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=870.3s	870.3	 And she nods.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=893.2s	893.2	 and say, nice job, Spiegel.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=930.4s	930.4	 And the intern, the chief resident attending,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=938.0s	938.0	 They said, let's ask the patient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=940.4s	940.4	 I don't think this has ever been done

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=992.6s	992.6	 we're born with this brain,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1260.9s	1260.9	 We've studied that, we've been very interested in that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1262.8s	1262.8	 And so we did a study where we selected highly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1267.5s	1267.5	 and non-hypnotizable people so we could do the comparison
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1271.7s	1271.7	 and then hypnotize them in the functional MRI scanner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1275.0s	1275.0	 And we found three things characterized the entry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1278.7s	1278.7	 into the hypnotic state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1280.2s	1280.2	 The first is turning down activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1282.2s	1282.2	 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1286.9s	1286.9	 of the brain as you well know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1288.9s	1288.9	 And it's part of what we call the salience network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1292.4s	1292.4	 It's a conflict detector.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1295.3s	1295.3	 So if you're engaged in work and you hear a loud noise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1300.1s	1300.1	 that you think might be a gunshot,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1303.6s	1303.6	 hey, wait a minute, there's a potential danger over there,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1306.1s	1306.1	 you better pay attention to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1307.3s	1307.3	 So it compares what you're doing with what else is going on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1311.6s	1311.6	 and helps you decide what to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1313.8s	1313.8	 And as you can imagine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1316.9s	1316.9	 turning down activity in that region,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1319.5s	1319.5	 you're going to make it less likely
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1320.3s	1320.3	 that you'll be distracted and pulled out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1321.2s	1321.2	 of whatever you're in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1322.9s	1322.9	 And in another study, we found that highly hypnotizable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1325.7s	1325.7	 people even without being hypnotized

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1332.2s	1332.2	 the anterior cingulate cortex

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1337.1s	1337.1	 So which is part of the key region
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1339.4s	1339.4	 in the executive control network.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1340.9s	1340.9	 So when you're engaging in tasks, you're enacting a plan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1344.7s	1344.7	 you're writing a paper, you're doing whatever you're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1346.5s	1346.5	 that's the prefrontal cortex is doing that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1350.0s	1350.0	 And so if that is coordinated,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1352.0s	1352.0	 we found more functional connectivity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1354.7s	1354.7	 So when one is up, the other's up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1357.1s	1357.1	 and one is down, the other's down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1358.6s	1358.6	 that coordination implies that the brain is saying,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1361.9s	1361.9	 okay, go ahead, I know what you're doing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1364.3s	1364.3	 carry out that plan and don't worry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1365.8s	1365.8	 about other possibilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1367.7s	1367.7	 So two other things happen when people are hypnotized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1370.6s	1370.6	 One is that that DLPFC has higher functional connectivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1374.2s	1374.2	 with the insula.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1377.1s	1377.1	 it's a part of the mind body control system,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1380.0s	1380.0	 sensitive to what's happening in the body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1381.9s	1381.9	 it's part of the pain network as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1384.2s	1384.2	 But it's also a region of the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1386.0s	1386.0	 where you can control things in your body

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1392.7s	1392.7	 where we took people who were highly hypnotizable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1395.9s	1395.9	 hypnotize them and told them to imagine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1398.5s	1398.5	 we went on an imaginary culinary tour.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1401.1s	1401.1	 So they would eat their favorite foods.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1404.4s	1404.4	 And we found that they increased
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1405.9s	1405.9	 their gastric acid secretion, like by 87%.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1412.6s	1412.6	 I mean, there was one woman, it was so vivid for her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1414.8s	1414.8	 that halfway through she said, let's stop, I'm full.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1417.4s	1417.4	 You know, eating these imaginary.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1419.0s	1419.0	 Having never eaten any actual food.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1422.0s	1422.0	 Incredible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1422.8s	1422.8	 And then we got them to relax
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1424.6s	1424.6	 and think of anything but food or drink.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1426.8s	1426.8	 And we got like a 40% decrease in gastric acid secretion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1431.4s	1431.4	 So they could, and that was DLPFC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1433.8s	1433.8	 through the insula telling the stomach,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1445.0s	1445.0	 they had a 19% reduction in gastric acid.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1479.4s	1479.4	 for example, in meditators.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1481.5s	1481.5	 And in meditation, you're supposed to be selfless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1483.8s	1483.8	 You're supposed to, the self is an illusion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1488.0s	1488.0	 And when you're doing that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1489.2s	1489.2	 the posterior cingulate is decreasing in activity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1495.5s	1495.5	 but I'm not thinking about what it means for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1498.0s	1498.0	 I may not even remember much of it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1895.4s	1895.4	 for falling back asleep in the middle of the night.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1912.2s	1912.2	 like so for instance, do self-hypnosis for stress reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1915.5s	1915.5	 away from the stressful event to prepare one

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1926.3s	1926.3	 but it's a kind of a training up of these networks, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1929.9s	1929.9	 That's right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1934.3s	1934.3	 actually form stronger connections
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1937.5s	1937.5	 when people do self-hypnosis over time?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=1971.3s	1971.3	 But is at Stanford, who said fire together, wire together,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2309.0s	2309.0	 about what it is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2400.0s	2400.0	 not avoid it, as we talked about before,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2463.5s	2463.5	 I got her floating.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2491.9s	2491.9	 So you're thinking good-speakled.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2515.0s	2515.0	 engages in some strategy of self-protection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2517.6s	2517.6	 That's the salience network kicking in.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2528.7s	2528.7	 that it was even worse than she thought it was,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2531.5s	2531.5	 that she actually probably saved her life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2533.8s	2533.8	 And so it was a way of helping her restructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2537.5s	2537.5	 her experience of the trauma and make it more tolerable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2540.7s	2540.7	 So that helped with her.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2542.3s	2542.3	 She didn't recognize, she couldn't identify the guy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2545.3s	2545.3	 but it helped her restructure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2547.7s	2547.7	 and understand her experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2549.1s	2549.1	 And that's something that you can do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2551.2s	2551.2	 in just talking straight out psychotherapy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2553.9s	2553.9	 but sometimes you can do it a hell of a lot faster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2556.7s	2556.7	 and more efficiently using hypnosis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2559.2s	2559.2	 And there is one randomized trial out of Israel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2561.7s	2561.7	 that shows that adding hypnosis to PTSD treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2564.2s	2564.2	 actually improves outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2566.2s	2566.2	 So it's a way of accomplishing things that we understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2572.4s	2572.4	 in the broader psychotherapy world,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2574.2s	2574.2	 but much more quickly and sometimes effectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2578.4s	2578.4	 Yeah, it sounds like going somewhat into the state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2581.6s	2581.6	 that one is trying to deal with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2583.2s	2583.2	 but then dissociating from that state is key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2585.6s	2585.6	 And I could imagine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2587.0s	2587.0	 and I've been open about this on various podcasts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2589.4s	2589.4	 I've done a lot of analysis over the years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2593.2s	2593.2	 So, but I've experienced myself that in those sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2597.4s	2597.4	 depending on how I show up to them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2599.2s	2599.2	 I might just get in kind of a laundry list of what happened
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2602.4s	2602.4	 as opposed to actually feeling anything
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2604.2s	2604.2	 around what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2606.4s	2606.4	 And I think people probably vary in the extent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2608.3s	2608.3	 to which they can drop into feeling states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2610.8s	2610.8	 and it can depend on the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2613.3s	2613.3	 It can be depend on how well you slept the night before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2616.1s	2616.1	 and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2617.0s	2617.0	 There's one thing I might add Andrew,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2618.9s	2618.9	 and that is, there's a notion of the late Gordon Bauer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2622.0s	2622.0	 We just had a memorial for Gordon at Stanford.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2625.2s	2625.2	 He died about a year ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2627.2s	2627.2	 Brilliant cognitive psychologist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2629.0s	2629.0	 So one of the founders of cognitive psychology at Stanford
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2633.2s	2633.2	 and a great pitcher.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2634.0s	2634.0	 He almost became a major league pitcher,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2635.4s	2635.4	 but he decided to go to grad school instead.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2637.4s	2637.4	 And I'm glad he did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2639.9s	2639.9	 But Gordon helped establish the concept
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2643.1s	2643.1	 of state dependent memory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2644.4s	2644.4	 That when you're in a certain mental state,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2647.1s	2647.1	 you enhance your ability to remember things about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2649.2s	2649.2	 And the sort of the bad example of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2651.1s	2651.1	 is the drunk who hides the bottle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2652.8s	2652.8	 and can't remember where he put it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2654.2s	2654.2	 until he gets drunk again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2655.2s	2655.2	 That he's in that same mental state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2658.2s	2658.2	 People go into dissociative states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2660.9s	2660.9	 when they're traumatized.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2662.5s	2662.5	 So in a way, hypnosis is helping them remember
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2666.1s	2666.1	 and deal with the memories better
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2667.4s	2667.4	 because they're more in the mental state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2669.4s	2669.4	 that is more like what happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2670.6s	2670.6	 And most rape victims will tell you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2672.9s	2672.9	 I was floating above my body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2674.7s	2674.7	 feeling sorry for the woman being assaulted below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2682.5s	2682.5	 I blank out, I don't know what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2684.0s	2684.0	 I'm on autopilot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2687.4s	2687.4	 So when you use hypnosis to help them deal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2690.6s	2690.6	 with the traumatic memory,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2692.0s	2692.0	 you're making the state they're in,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2693.6s	2693.6	 right there in your office with you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2695.6s	2695.6	 more congruent to the state they were likely in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2698.1s	2698.1	 when the trauma happened.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2699.2s	2699.2	 And I think that is part of what helps facilitate treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2702.7s	2702.7	 of trauma related disorders.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2704.6s	2704.6	 I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2705.9s	2705.9	 So that makes me have to ask every question I have to ask
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2709.4s	2709.4	 because I really feel it as almost a compulsion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2715.7s	2715.7	 is part of the adaptive strategy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2720.1s	2720.1	 but it creates certain issues, it creates problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2724.7s	2724.7	 Why would something like ketamine,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2727.3s	2727.3	 which creates a dissociative state,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2732.4s	2732.4	 This is what I'm confused about these days

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2740.6s	2740.6	 okay, there's these layer one networks in the neocortex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2743.8s	2743.8	 and those are involved in dissociative state.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2745.4s	2745.4	 And so we're starting to gain some understanding
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2746.8s	2746.8	 of how ketamine works at a neural level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2749.9s	2749.9	 It does seem as if for certain populations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2752.8s	2752.8	 it can be a useful treatment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2754.9s	2754.9	 I don't know, I've never tried it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2788.1s	2788.1	 and the rats actually showed dissociative-like behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2792.0s	2792.0	 in that they would touch a hot pad
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2794.2s	2794.2	 that they ordinarily wouldn't

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2803.2s	2803.2	 Human.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2805.6s	2805.6	 And the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2810.8s	2810.8	 and when they did, he would report
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2812.8s	2812.8	 being in a dissociative state.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2815.8s	2815.8	 it's like being a pilot of an airplane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2817.8s	2817.8	 and then I felt myself walking out of the cockpit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2820.6s	2820.6	 and the plane was still flying.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2821.9s	2821.9	 And it was- It sounds terrifying to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2823.9s	2823.9	 It sounds terrifying.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2826.6s	2826.6	 most of the time, you know.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2828.8s	2828.8	 That's right, but the point is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2831.4s	2831.4	 in a way the principle, Andrew,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2833.1s	2833.1	 is like the principle you said
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2834.6s	2834.6	 you need to reconfront a traumatic situation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2837.9s	2837.9	 before you can modulate your associations to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2841.3s	2841.3	 So you have to accept it, accept the arousal,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2844.6s	2844.6	 put some boundaries around it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2845.9s	2845.9	 and then figure out how you can approach that problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2848.4s	2848.4	 or how you did approach that problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2849.9s	2849.9	 from a different point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2851.4s	2851.4	 So it does not surprise.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2853.0s	2853.0	 In fact, we've studied people who dissociated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2856.1s	2856.1	 during the Loma Prieta earthquake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2858.2s	2858.2	 and the Oakland Berkeley firestorm.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2860.4s	2860.4	 I remember both of those well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2861.6s	2861.6	 Yeah. Earthquakes follow me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2862.8s	2862.8	 And then I moved south and then the Northridge.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2865.0s	2865.0	 I'm gonna keep away from you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2865.9s	2865.9	 So there'll be one layer this afternoon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2867.2s	2867.2	 I'm starting to dissociate, Andrew.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2870.4s	2870.4	 So dissociation does compartmentalize experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2875.4s	2875.4	 but that means from the point of view of treating trauma,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2878.2s	2878.2	 it's an inhibition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2880.4s	2880.4	 You don't engage it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2881.6s	2881.6	 It's like it happened over there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2883.0s	2883.0	 And I think what happens is that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2885.8s	2885.8	 are sometimes too good at being able to separate themselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2888.8s	2888.8	 from the recollection.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2889.7s	2889.7	 So it's in there somewhere.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2891.6s	2891.6	 It's out of sight, but it's not out of mind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2893.3s	2893.3	 It's having effects on you, but you can't deal with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2895.6s	2895.6	 You can't reprocess it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2897.3s	2897.3	 So I do think one reason ketamine might work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2900.8s	2900.8	 is that in fact, it allows you to re-approach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2907.7s	2907.7	 the dissociative experience in a way
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2909.4s	2909.4	 that you can then start to think about
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2911.0s	2911.0	 and do something about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2912.1s	2912.1	 And just the fact you can turn it on and off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2914.4s	2914.4	 And that's also where self-hypnosis is so helpful.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2917.6s	2917.6	 It's not something that just comes over you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2919.4s	2919.4	 and happens to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2920.6s	2920.6	 It's something you can make happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2921.6s	2921.6	 You can control it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2922.5s	2922.5	 You can do something with it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2923.9s	2923.9	 So you feel less helpless and out of control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2926.6s	2926.6	 The essence of trauma is helplessness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2928.4s	2928.4	 It's not fear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2929.3s	2929.3	 It's not pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2930.1s	2930.1	 It's helplessness.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2931.0s	2931.0	 You become an object.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2932.6s	2932.6	 You become just your body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2934.2s	2934.2	 You don't control what's going on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2935.6s	2935.6	 We're not used to that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2945.9s	2945.9	 or hold your breath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2946.9s	2946.9	 It's that if you think you can inhale and you can't,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2950.3s	2950.3	 that is really upsetting, understandably.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2952.7s	2952.7	 And so the issue is control.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2955.1s	2955.1	 And hypnosis, which has this terrible reputation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=2958.2s	2958.2	 of taking away control,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3300.8s	3300.8	 does it work long-term?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3302.0s	3302.0	 Because what we can do acutely

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3307.7s	3307.7	 with metastatic breast cancer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3313.0s	3313.0	 and taught them self-hypnosis for stress and anxiety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3316.7s	3316.7	 and pain control at the end.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3320.7s	3320.7	 the treatment group had half the pain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3325.6s	3325.6	 So it lasts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3326.5s	3326.5	 And they would say, when I felt that pain in my chest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3329.9s	3329.9	 and thought it was a metastasis, I just did the exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3353.0s	3353.0	 whether it's likely to help you or not.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3357.2s	3357.2	 That's great.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3367.4s	3367.4	 I think that, you know, the, as you mentioned,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3443.9s	3443.9	 I know a few people like that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3511.4s	3511.4	 but sometimes they overdo it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3513.6s	3513.6	 And it's painful to listen to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3516.4s	3516.4	 because you know what's gonna happen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3517.6s	3517.6	 So it's kind of a balance we have to hit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3521.3s	3521.3	 Sometimes we get too emotional and too absorbed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3523.6s	3523.6	 and you're not with it enough
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3526.2s	3526.2	 to sort of see other possibilities.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3528.2s	3528.2	 That can be a problem.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3529.1s	3529.1	 But on the other hand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3529.9s	3529.9	 sometimes you're too rigid and controlled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3532.0s	3532.0	 and you don't let your emotions guide you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3534.4s	3534.4	 to what you need to do to protect yourself or protect others.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3537.6s	3537.6	 So I would say in general that people with OCD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3541.8s	3541.8	 are on the less hypnotizable side of the spectrum.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3545.8s	3545.8	 They're less likely to allow themselves to engage in anything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3549.0s	3549.0	 The typical example is the checking with OCD, for example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3552.2s	3552.2	 They don't remember whether they locked the door
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3557.0s	3557.0	 or turned off the gas in the oven,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3558.4s	3558.4	 and they keep going back and they keep checking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3560.1s	3560.1	 So there, the evaluative component of the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3563.6s	3563.6	 kind of overrides the experiential one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3566.2s	3566.2	 And sometimes people can get some benefit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3569.4s	3569.4	 but they're not a group that I would select
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3572.5s	3572.5	 for being the most likely to respond
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3575.2s	3575.2	 to self-hypnotic approaches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3577.6s	3577.6	 Are superstitions similar?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3580.5s	3580.5	 Superstitions, I think that's more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3584.3s	3584.3	 There are people who are very hypnotizable,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3587.8s	3587.8	 who keep getting caught up in things like superstitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3591.1s	3591.1	 And there, the imagination supplants the reality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3595.3s	3595.3	 And we've seen a lot of that happening recently.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3598.2s	3598.2	 And so I think there, it's possible
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3602.2s	3602.2	 that they could be helped by learning to sort of see it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3605.3s	3605.3	 but put it in context, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3607.0s	3607.0	 see it from a different point of view.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3609.1s	3609.1	 I developed a pretty vicious superstition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3611.1s	3611.1	 when I was in college, and it was hard to break, actually.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3614.8s	3614.8	 I always feel that when I talk to clinicians,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3617.0s	3617.0	 I have to reveal certain things about my own pathology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3619.9s	3619.9	 You'll get my bill later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3620.9s	3620.9	 Thank you, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3622.2s	3622.2	 It's part of the reason I arranged this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3623.6s	3623.6	 I'm just kidding.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3624.5s	3624.5	 But yeah, I did.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3625.3s	3625.3	 I had a habit of knocking on wood for things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3628.2s	3628.2	 and then I noticed it started to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3632.9s	3632.9	 I would sneak knocking on wood every once in a while,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3635.5s	3635.5	 because I didn't want people to think I was doing too often.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3637.4s	3637.4	 And then I started to realize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3638.2s	3638.2	 that it was becoming a little bit of a reflex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3641.4s	3641.4	 And then I saw this incredible video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3643.8s	3643.8	 from Bence Olewski's lab at Harvard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3645.9s	3645.9	 He studies motor patterns.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3647.5s	3647.5	 He has these rats that press different sequences
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3649.8s	3649.8	 of levers and turn dials in order to get a pellet of food.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3654.4s	3654.4	 But that as they do that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3655.5s	3655.5	 they'll start to introduce these behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3657.0s	3657.0	 that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3659.8s	3659.8	 Like they'll start scratching their hindquarters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3662.2s	3662.2	 and things like that, and their head,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3664.7s	3664.7	 excuse me, they don't wear hats and flipping their ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3666.8s	3666.8	 And this is just like a picture before throwing a baseball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3671.4s	3671.4	 That we do this, we start to incorporate motor behaviors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3675.2s	3675.2	 that are unrelated to the outcome,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3677.2s	3677.2	 but our mind somehow starts to think
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3679.8s	3679.8	 that they're necessary for the outcome.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3681.6s	3681.6	 And so then you incorporate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3682.7s	3682.7	 So I decided to break it by simply forcing myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3685.1s	3685.1	 to not do it for about a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3686.9s	3686.9	 And then it just seemed like a ridiculous thing to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3689.3s	3689.3	 Yeah, well, we call that response prevention and it works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3693.5s	3693.5	 Because what you do is you set up a new context
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3696.8s	3696.8	 in your brain where you get the outcome you want
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3699.6s	3699.6	 devoid of the extraneous behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3703.1s	3703.1	 And I knew it was nuts, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3704.9s	3704.9	 I knew it was illogical.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3706.4s	3706.4	 But somehow these things take on meaning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3709.8s	3709.8	 So we talked about stress reduction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3712.0s	3712.0	 the utility of hypnosis for stress reduction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3715.2s	3715.2	 phobias, pain, possibly, we don't know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3721.6s	3721.6	 it just will depend on hypnotizability.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3725.0s	3725.0	 You talked about this beautiful study
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3726.7s	3726.7	 on the breast cancer outcome or patients.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3733.1s	3733.1	 Hypnotizability is clearly a key variable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3736.0s	3736.0	 So could you please tell us what hypnotizability is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3740.8s	3740.8	 how it's evaluated, and what the Spiegel-Iral test is?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3745.1s	3745.1	 Okay, sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3745.9s	3745.9	 So hypnotizability is just a capacity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3751.4s	3751.4	 to have hypnotic experiences.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3765.1s	3765.1	 talking, walking upstairs and downstairs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=3775.9s	3775.9	 the less you can make a variation in outcome.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4301.8s	4301.8	 Yeah, there's an interesting book on the history
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4304.2s	4304.2	 of the national parks that says that they didn't give

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4308.7s	4308.7	 but there was no Google Maps, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4310.6s	4310.6	 That's very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4311.6s	4311.6	 Yeah, panorama and visual boundaries
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4314.4s	4314.4	 are really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4315.4s	4315.4	 I think, so the eyes, as we both know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4317.9s	4317.9	 are two pieces of the central nervous system
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4320.1s	4320.1	 of the brain outside the-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4322.4s	4322.4	 I used to say that the eyes are outside the skull
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4324.6s	4324.6	 and a neuro-ophthalmologist said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4327.7s	4327.7	 there, wrote to me and vehemently pointed out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4331.4s	4331.4	 that they are outside the cranial vault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4333.4s	4333.4	 So, you know, they're outside the cranial vault,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4335.8s	4335.8	 but they are two pieces of brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4337.0s	4337.0	 They're out there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4337.9s	4337.9	 And so you mentioned cranial nerves, three, four, and six.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4341.0s	4341.0	 This isn't a neuroanatomy course,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4342.4s	4342.4	 but maybe we could go a little deeper there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4344.6s	4344.6	 So you said there's contradictory activity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4346.6s	4346.6	 Looking up is controlled by the one set of cranial nerves

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4353.3s	4353.3	 is controlled by another cranial nerve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4355.8s	4355.8	 No, it's the same one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4357.0s	4357.0	 I think it's six, that when you close your eyes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4362.3s	4362.3	 you activate, no, it's the facial,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4366.6s	4366.6	 I guess it's the facial nerve.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4367.8s	4367.8	 It's seven.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4369.0s	4369.0	 Seven, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4370.3s	4370.3	 But you're looking up, you're activating the muscles
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4375.4s	4375.4	 that force your eyes to look up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4378.1s	4378.1	 And the closing your eyelids normally relaxes those,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4383.6s	4383.6	 relaxes that upper movement because your eyes are closed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4385.4s	4385.4	 and you don't need to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4386.8s	4386.8	 So you're breaking a usual customary pattern.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4390.2s	4390.2	 It's like the rubbing, hey, I can't even do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4392.2s	4392.2	 See, it's like the,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4393.1s	4393.1	 it's like rubbing your tummy and patting your head.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4396.2s	4396.2	 It's a bit, there's a bit of a conflict there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4399.2s	4399.2	 But clinically, it's been a good probe for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4402.1s	4402.1	 and for your father.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4405.5s	4405.5	 That's Spiegel Senior.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4410.2s	4410.2	 normally when we close our eyes also, we're going to sleep.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4420.2s	4420.2	 So you're focusing, but you're turning inward.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4423.0s	4423.0	 That's an unusual state.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4426.6s	4426.6	 We have to, but when you close your eyes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4429.4s	4429.4	 for some period of time, it's normally to go to sleep

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4438.7s	4438.7	 because you're turning inward, basically.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4441.2s	4441.2	 You're looking up, you're shutting your eyes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4450.6s	4450.6	 to turn inward.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4471.6s	4471.6	 Obviously a third cannot, but within the two thirds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4494.9s	4494.9	 but not a hell of a lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4588.0s	4588.0	 I've heard things like it coordinates the two sides

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4618.5s	4618.5	 in one of your recent podcasts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4624.9s	4624.9	 from a bemused point of view is the old,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4630.8s	4630.8	 of a hypnotic induction was a dangling watch, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4634.1s	4634.1	 You know, and the watch.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4636.4s	4636.4	 And in fact, there was enough concern about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4639.7s	4639.7	 that when automobiles were invented,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4641.7s	4641.7	 there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4646.0s	4646.0	 because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4649.6s	4649.6	 if they watched the windshield wipers go back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4651.9s	4651.9	 and forth on a car.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4656.8s	4656.8	 at the windshield wipers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4657.6s	4657.6	 You keep looking through the windshield.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4662.8s	4662.8	 But that movement is what exactly used
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4665.6s	4665.6	 to be a hypnotic induction.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4673.0s	4673.0	 with exposure-based treatments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4675.8s	4675.8	 where you use EMDR to think about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4677.8s	4677.8	 You tend not to process the experience as much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4681.1s	4681.1	 and just do the physical part of it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4683.2s	4683.2	 which I personally think is a drawback.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4685.4s	4685.4	 And every study I've seen that was a dismantling study,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4689.5s	4689.5	 there's no question that people who go through EMDR,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4691.9s	4691.9	 many of them get better with trauma-related problems
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4694.7s	4694.7	 and the VA has a big program using it and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4697.5s	4697.5	 But every program that has dismantled

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4701.9s	4701.9	 with having the lateral eye movement

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4706.4s	4706.4	 doesn't add anything to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4707.8s	4707.8	 And toward the end of her career,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4709.9s	4709.9	 Francine was doing now contralateral touching or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4714.5s	4714.5	 It wasn't eye movements anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4715.9s	4715.9	 It was other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4716.8s	4716.8	 So I tend to think that EMDR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4722.5s	4722.5	 is another form of exposure-based therapy for trauma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4725.7s	4725.7	 But as you've implied,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4728.0s	4728.0	 with the exception of this possible new data,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4732.0s	4732.0	 with rapid eye movement sleep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4733.8s	4733.8	 And I don't think moving the eyes is the issue.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4736.5s	4736.5	 I think it's a way of sitting down and confronting trauma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4739.6s	4739.6	 And I would rather that the trauma itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4741.7s	4741.7	 be processed a bit more than often happens in EMDR.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4748.6s	4748.6	 Francine used to originally claim

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4753.5s	4753.5	 And that's clearly not true.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4827.4s	4827.4	 but usually the affect is constant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4830.4s	4830.4	 Said, usually if it's a frustration dream,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4832.7s	4832.7	 whatever happens, you wind up frustrated.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4862.1s	4862.1	 and somehow not that scared?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4876.8s	4876.8	 Right, so EMDR might incorporate some elements of hypnosis.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4910.6s	4910.6	 is this idea of getting close to the phobia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4916.4s	4916.4	 getting close to the trauma,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4922.4s	4922.4	 and rewiring something.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4926.6s	4926.6	 is no longer as horrible to us.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4971.7s	4971.7	 that we're trying to move away from troubling things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4983.4s	4983.4	 but whether or not you brought yourself there voluntarily.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=4991.5s	4991.5	 deciding I'm going to confront the trauma,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5639.3s	5639.3	 with advanced breast cancer, we lost people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5642.3s	5642.3	 And I gotta tell you that we were warned by oncologists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5644.9s	5644.9	 that we demoralize people that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5647.0s	5647.0	 I mean, there were wonderful oncologists,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5648.4s	5648.4	 but there were some that were very afraid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5650.0s	5650.0	 that we would harm them in some way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5653.1s	5653.1	 because the mortality rate is fairly high
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5656.6s	5656.6	 with metastatic breast cancer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5662.3s	5662.3	 And so we actually measured their emotion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5666.0s	5666.0	 and the content of speech every five minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5668.3s	5668.3	 throughout a bunch of groups
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5669.4s	5669.4	 to make sure that wasn't happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5670.6s	5670.6	 What we found was that they talked about more serious issues,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5673.8s	5673.8	 but the mood didn't actually get worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5675.9s	5675.9	 And we found in general that expressing negative emotion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5679.0s	5679.0	 on the long run helps people be less anxious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5681.2s	5681.2	 and depressed over time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5682.2s	5682.2	 And we've shown this in randomized clinical trials,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5684.4s	5684.4	 so it's not just my clinical impression.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5687.3s	5687.3	 And what we try to get them to do is to face a loss,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5694.7s	5694.7	 live with the emotion that comes with it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5696.3s	5696.3	 but also see that the reason it hurts so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5698.9s	5698.9	 is how much that person gave you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5701.5s	5701.5	 So we would do a self-hypnosis exercise at the end of the group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5703.7s	5703.7	 and say, I want you to get your body floating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5705.7s	5705.7	 safe and comfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5707.0s	5707.0	 Now picture Mary and sit with the feeling of sadness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5711.5s	5711.5	 that she's no longer with us.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5713.5s	5713.5	 And we do that for a few minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5715.0s	5715.0	 And then we'd say on the other side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5716.8s	5716.8	 picture one thing she left with you that you still have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5719.7s	5719.7	 that you carry on in her tradition of what she gave to you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5724.6s	5724.6	 And so just seeing it not as a complete loss,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5728.2s	5728.2	 but as a real loss, a painful loss,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5730.8s	5730.8	 but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5733.6s	5733.6	 from her and knowing her,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5735.8s	5735.8	 I think can be very helpful in the grieving process.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5738.6s	5738.6	 That's very helpful way to conceptualize it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5742.1s	5742.1	 Couple of quick questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5744.8s	5744.8	 Can children be safely hypnotized or do self-hypnosis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5750.2s	5750.2	 It's sometimes harder for them to do self-hypnosis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5752.9s	5752.9	 They need more structure to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5754.6s	5754.6	 You've got to share your dorsal or prefrontal cortex
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5758.4s	5758.4	 with them a little bit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5759.7s	5759.7	 But yes, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5760.9s	5760.9	 Children can be very hypnotizable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5763.0s	5763.0	 And I know pediatricians who use it wonderfully
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5767.6s	5767.6	 all the time, they get them to focus on something else.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5770.8s	5770.8	 So they're gonna have to give them a shot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5772.6s	5772.6	 or draw blood or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5774.0s	5774.0	 And they'll say, I'm gonna press your happy button
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5778.4s	5778.4	 and presses their belly button.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5780.1s	5780.1	 And they start to giggle the way kids do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5781.9s	5781.9	 And meanwhile, the nurse is drawing the blood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5785.3s	5785.3	 and they don't even notice it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5786.3s	5786.3	 Dentists, good dentists can use it to help kids
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5789.0s	5789.0	 with fear and pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5790.4s	5790.4	 So yes, it can be very effective for children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5792.8s	5792.8	 We did a randomized trial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5794.1s	5794.1	 I have a publication in pediatrics,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5796.0s	5796.0	 my late sister who was a pediatrician
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5798.9s	5798.9	 and who always used to joke that she was the only one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5801.7s	5801.7	 in our family who was a real doctor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5804.7s	5804.7	 I said, I got you, I got a paper in pediatrics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5808.0s	5808.0	 And the paper was children having to undergo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5811.5s	5811.5	 avoiding cystourethragrams.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5813.2s	5813.2	 So the anatomy of the kidney, if you'll forgive me,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5816.9s	5816.9	 is sort of interesting in that the ureter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5820.0s	5820.0	 that goes into the bladder normally goes into the bladder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5823.2s	5823.2	 at an angle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5824.2s	5824.2	 And so that means that when the bladder contracts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5826.8s	5826.8	 to expel urine, it automatically closes off the ureter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5830.8s	5830.8	 because it's sideways to the bladder.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5832.8s	5832.8	 Some kids are born with it perpendicular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5834.9s	5834.9	 and then you'll get reflux into the kidney.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5837.2s	5837.2	 And some children outgrow it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5839.3s	5839.3	 Some need pretty complicated surgery to fix that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5842.8s	5842.8	 And so you image them every year or so
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5846.0s	5846.0	 to see whether they're getting kidney damage or not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5848.7s	5848.7	 And it's a pretty miserable experience.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5850.5s	5850.5	 You're a nine-year-old girl,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5852.1s	5852.1	 you have to go and lie on a hard cold table,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5854.0s	5854.0	 have strangers pull your legs apart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5855.7s	5855.7	 and stick a catheter into your urethra
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5858.5s	5858.5	 and hold in the bladder and then expel urine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5861.8s	5861.8	 And so you get into these struggling fights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5863.9s	5863.9	 And of course, the more they struggle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5865.2s	5865.2	 the more they constrict and it makes it harder to do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5867.6s	5867.6	 So I was asked if we could test it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5871.1s	5871.1	 So we did a randomized trial at Children's Hospital.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5874.2s	5874.2	 They either got training in self-hypnosis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5876.3s	5876.3	 I would meet with them and the mother the week before.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5881.5s	5881.5	 And I'd say, you're gonna play a trick on your doctors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5883.8s	5883.8	 Your body's there, you're somewhere else.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5895.4s	5895.4	 One got so relaxed, he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5897.7s	5897.7	 normally it takes us 10 minutes to get them to pee

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5901.2s	5901.2	 She was so relaxed, she started peeing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5902.8s	5902.8	 before I could even get the bed pan under her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5905.2s	5905.2	 and I had to clean up the table.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5907.3s	5907.3	 And they also, 17 minutes shorter procedures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5910.5s	5910.5	 And that's a long 17 minutes for a little kid.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5913.9s	5913.9	 So it can be very effective with children.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5916.6s	5916.6	 They're less anxious, they have less pain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5922.4s	5922.4	 That's great.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5927.6s	5927.6	 I'm thinking of pretty much every clinical setting here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5929.9s	5929.9	 Both people have to be hypnotizable, of course.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5932.5s	5932.5	 But the reason I ask about this is next,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5934.8s	5934.8	 I'm gonna ask about psychedelics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5936.6s	5936.6	 and there's a lot of interest in coordinating states
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5939.7s	5939.7	 through the use of drugs of different kinds.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5944.1s	5944.1	 We actually do this when we treat depression, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5945.9s	5945.9	 You have a depressed person with a family members

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5949.4s	5949.4	 well, let's make them all not depressed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5952.3s	5952.3	 Right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5953.1s	5953.1	 I mean, but in all, and I'm only half kidding there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5956.0s	5956.0	 because that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5958.6s	5958.6	 But are you aware of any coordinated hypnosis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5963.8s	5963.8	 That's interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5968.0s	5968.0	 You can hypnotize large groups at once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5970.0s	5970.0	 Yeah, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5970.8s	5970.8	 Are we hypnotized right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5971.6s	5971.6	 Yeah, you are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5972.5s	5972.5	 I hope you've been enjoying it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5979.2s	5979.2	 there was a group of like 10 women
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5980.6s	5980.6	 who would meet once a week
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5981.7s	5981.7	 and we would all go into hypnosis together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5984.5s	5984.5	 I didn't realize that you were hypnotizing them collectively.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5987.3s	5987.3	 Yes, yes, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5988.9s	5988.9	 Fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5989.7s	5989.7	 And that, you know, if anything,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5991.2s	5991.2	 I think it brings out the best in people's abilities
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5993.7s	5993.7	 because it's a shared social experience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5995.8s	5995.8	 and they would talk about it afterwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=5999.3s	5999.3	 And so, yes, that's absolutely doable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6001.8s	6001.8	 Yeah.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6005.2s	6005.2	 Maybe that's a topic for a future episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6007.0s	6007.0	 but is there any basis for combining hypnosis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6010.8s	6010.8	 with drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6017.3s	6017.3	 might be prescribed antidepressant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6025.1s	6025.1	 is being directed toward.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6030.9s	6030.9	 through the use of a propranolol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6044.0s	6044.0	 is we did spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6053.4s	6053.4	 between hypnotizability and GABA activity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6137.9s	6137.9	 and you'll have less control over it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6139.6s	6139.6	 So they might be adjuvants,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6142.6s	6142.6	 but I frankly think hypnosis is more of a replacement
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6145.8s	6145.8	 than a need of supplementation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6148.7s	6148.7	 Your laboratory, my laboratory have,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6154.3s	6154.3	 and trying to kind of merge the two.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6156.2s	6156.2	 It's been a lot of fun and we're learning a lot
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6159.0s	6159.0	 about the power of respiration of breathing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6162.0s	6162.0	 to shift brain states, not just during breathing protocols,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6165.4s	6165.4	 but at all times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6166.9s	6166.9	 And we will do an entire episode about those protocols.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6169.5s	6169.5	 I think after those are published and so on.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6174.4s	6174.4	 But breathing itself, as you've described,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6178.7s	6178.7	 is a bridge between conscious and unconscious states.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6181.5s	6181.5	 And so I have to ask how important
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6185.6s	6185.6	 is the patient's breathing pattern?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6188.0s	6188.0	 How closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6191.2s	6191.2	 How closely do you monitor your own breathing pattern
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6193.6s	6193.6	 as you're inducing hypnosis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6195.5s	6195.5	 Put simply, what is the role of respiration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6197.9s	6197.9	 in shifting the brain's state during a hypnotic protocol?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6203.6s	6203.6	 Yeah, that's very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6204.6s	6204.6	 You had a great show with Jack.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6206.5s	6206.5	 Yeah, Jack Feldman.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6209.4s	6209.4	 He is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6210.2s	6210.2	 And the issue, I watch it, I try,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6217.9s	6217.9	 the work that we're enjoying doing together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6220.4s	6220.4	 shows that there are breathing patterns
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6221.9s	6221.9	 that may increase sympathetic arousal or may decrease it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6226.6s	6226.6	 May help in, you know, cyclic sighing seems to actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6230.1s	6230.1	 where you have more time spent exhaling than inhaling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6233.6s	6233.6	 seem, and there's reason to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6235.6s	6235.6	 that it induces parasympathetic activity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6239.1s	6239.1	 because you're increasing pressure in the chest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6240.8s	6240.8	 And therefore allowing the heart to slow down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6244.5s	6244.5	 because blood is being returned to the atrium more easily.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6249.6s	6249.6	 I do use it, I ask people to take a deep breath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6252.6s	6252.6	 as part of the induction and then slowly exhale.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6255.1s	6255.1	 And partly as a result of our research together,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6257.3s	6257.3	 I'm emphasizing the slow exhale more as part of,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6262.0s	6262.0	 to enhance the idea in the induction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6263.9s	6263.9	 that this is a period of relaxation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6265.7s	6265.7	 Because I think they are inducing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6268.3s	6268.3	 and perhaps perceiving it as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6271.0s	6271.0	 So there's no, you're absolutely right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6274.2s	6274.2	 that breathing is very interesting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6278.3s	6278.3	 And Jack talked about that too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6279.8s	6279.8	 of conscious and unconscious control,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6281.4s	6281.4	 that it will go on automatically, but we can control it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6284.9s	6284.9	 And so it's a kind of way for us to demonstrate to ourselves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6290.4s	6290.4	 greater ways of modulating our internal state.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6296.4s	6296.4	 the way we do with pain control and hypnosis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6299.0s	6299.0	 or you can do it to some extent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6300.5s	6300.5	 by taking charge of your breathing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6303.7s	6303.7	 and doing things that will produce a change
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6306.0s	6306.0	 that you wanna see happen in your body.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6311.0s	6311.0	 where you can enhance.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6316.6s	6316.6	 more than medication.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6320.8s	6320.8	 Great, I'm really excited to see where all of this goes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctD-ki8dCc&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=75&pp=iAQB&t=6323.6s	6323.6	 Breathing, vision, bodily states, clearly the,
