https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=788.3s	788.3	 of course, when they knock on my door,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=789.5s	789.5	 it's always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=792.0s	792.0	 Even though I love to talk to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 But I walk around my lab from time to time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=794.9s	794.9	 and some people I notice I'll say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=797.6s	797.6	 do you have a moment?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=798.4s	798.4	 And they'll slowly turn around and say, yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=800.8s	800.8	 or no, in some cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=803.5s	803.5	 And other people will jump the moment I say their name.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=806.2s	806.2	 They actually have a kind of a heightened startle reflex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=810.7s	810.7	 Is that related to impulsivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=812.3s	812.3	 or is what you're referring to an attempt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=815.1s	815.1	 to withhold behavior that's very deliberate

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=823.2s	823.2	 is necessarily related to impulsivity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=825.4s	825.4	 That can be related to anxiety.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=827.4s	827.4	 So people who are high anxiety people will tend to have
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=830.5s	830.5	 more of a startle reflex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=832.2s	832.2	 Impulsivity is a little bit different.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=834.2s	834.2	 And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=838.0s	838.0	 Impulsivity is that thing where there's not a lot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=854.0s	854.0	 where that's absolutely wonderful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=862.8s	862.8	 between people where you wouldn't really wanna be

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=875.0s	875.0	 like battle scenarios, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=892.3s	892.3	 of practicing psychiatry is that what we now conceptualize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=897.5s	897.5	 in our current ecosystem as mental illness

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=906.5s	906.5	 might be very advantageous.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=908.6s	908.6	 They're just not advantageous right now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=918.2s	918.2	 Because we live in this world that's sort of like

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=932.6s	932.6	 That we're being bombarded with all these opportunities,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=936.1s	936.1	 these sensory opportunities.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=939.7s	939.7	 And so impulsivity is something that right now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=943.8s	943.8	 can be a difficult trait,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=965.8s	965.8	 and if you don't mind painting a picture

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=980.5s	980.5	 what is this thing that we call pleasure?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=983.2s	983.2	 Well, I think it's actually really hard to define pleasure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=987.0s	987.0	 in any kind of succinct way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=993.8s	993.8	 or a euphoria or I think the kind of experience

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1017.0s	1017.0	 sometimes their initial foray into using a drug

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1032.9s	1032.9	 even those who initially were seeking out pleasure

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1421.9s	1421.9	 in your book, Dopamine Nation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1428.2s	1428.2	 about one another is because neither of you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1429.9s	1429.9	 are on social media.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1431.6s	1431.6	 And yet you're two of the most productive people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1434.0s	1434.0	 that I know, including productive authors.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1438.2s	1438.2	 But I find this fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1439.9s	1439.9	 So let's talk about the pleasure, pain, balance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1444.7s	1444.7	 and addiction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1446.1s	1446.1	 And I've heard you use this seesaw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1448.0s	1448.0	 or balance scale analogy before.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1451.3s	1451.3	 And I think it's a wonderful one that really for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1455.3s	1455.3	 clarified what addiction is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1458.5s	1458.5	 at least at the mechanistic level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1461.6s	1461.6	 Yeah, so to me, one of the most significant findings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1464.2s	1464.2	 in neuroscience in the last 75 years
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1466.4s	1466.4	 is that pleasure and pain are co-located,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1469.4s	1469.4	 which means the same parts of the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1471.1s	1471.1	 that process pleasure also process pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1474.1s	1474.1	 And they work like a balance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1476.7s	1476.7	 So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1478.7s	1478.7	 When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1481.7s	1481.7	 And one of the overriding rules governing this balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1485.0s	1485.0	 is that it wants to stay level.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1486.6s	1486.6	 So it doesn't wanna remain tipped very long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1488.4s	1488.4	 to pleasure or to pain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1490.0s	1490.0	 And with any deviation from neutrality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1492.5s	1492.5	 the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1496.0s	1496.0	 or what scientists call homeostasis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1498.4s	1498.4	 And the way the brain does that is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1500.7s	1500.7	 with any stimulus to one side,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1503.4s	1503.4	 there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1506.5s	1506.5	 to the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1507.8s	1507.8	 It's like the principle laws of physics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1509.7s	1509.7	 Yes, right, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1511.1s	1511.1	 So like I like to watch YouTube videos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1513.2s	1513.2	 when I watch YouTube videos of American Idol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1516.3s	1516.3	 it tips to the side of pleasure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1518.2s	1518.2	 And then when I stop watching it, I have a come down, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1522.3s	1522.3	 Which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1525.7s	1525.7	 on the other side.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1526.6s	1526.6	 And that's that moment of wanting to watch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1528.6s	1528.6	 one more YouTube video, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1530.2s	1530.2	 Yeah, and I just wanna interject there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1533.2s	1533.2	 So this moment of wanting to watch another
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1537.7s	1537.7	 that is associated with pain, I think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1540.6s	1540.6	 is are we always aware of that happening?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1543.6s	1543.6	 Because you just described it in a very conscious way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1546.4s	1546.4	 But when I indulge in something I enjoy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1549.8s	1549.8	 I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1553.0s	1553.0	 I don't think about the pain, I just think about more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1556.2s	1556.2	 Right, so really excellent point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1558.6s	1558.6	 because we're mostly not aware of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1560.7s	1560.7	 And it's also reflexive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1562.4s	1562.4	 So it's not something that consciously happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1565.6s	1565.6	 or that we're aware of unless we really
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1567.8s	1567.8	 begin to pay attention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1569.8s	1569.8	 And when we begin to pay attention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1572.7s	1572.7	 we really can become very aware of it in the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1576.0s	1576.0	 Again, it's like a falling away,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1578.2s	1578.2	 like that you're on social media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1580.6s	1580.6	 and you get a good tweet of something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1583.4s	1583.4	 and then you can't stop yourself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1586.1s	1586.1	 because there's this awareness, a latent awareness,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1588.8s	1588.8	 that as soon as I disengage from this behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1591.4s	1591.4	 I'm going to experience a kind of a pain,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1594.5s	1594.5	 a falling away, a missing that feeling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1597.9s	1597.9	 a wanting more of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1599.8s	1599.8	 And of course, one way to combat that is to do it more,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1603.7s	1603.7	 and more and more and more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1605.2s	1605.2	 So I think that is really what I want people to tune into
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1608.9s	1608.9	 and get an awareness around.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1610.8s	1610.8	 Because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1613.8s	1613.8	 And then when you begin to see it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1615.6s	1615.6	 you have, and if you keep the model of the balance in mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1618.7s	1618.7	 I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1624.0s	1624.0	 what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1627.3s	1627.3	 and understand it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1628.9s	1628.9	 And in that understanding, get some mastery over it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1631.7s	1631.7	 which is really what this is all about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1633.8s	1633.8	 Because ultimately, we do need to disengage, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1637.1s	1637.1	 We can't live in that space all the time, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1641.2s	1641.2	 We have other things we need to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1643.2s	1643.2	 And there are also serious consequences

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1922.2s	1922.2	 or video games or sex or a narrative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1924.1s	1924.1	 about a previous lover or partner or whatever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1928.2s	1928.2	 It's the same addictive process underneath that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1931.1s	1931.1	 Is that correct?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1938.9s	1938.9	 severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1944.7s	1944.7	 does the same, is what you just said also true for behaviors?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1948.0s	1948.0	 Yes, so when I use the word drug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1950.3s	1950.3	 I'm talking about substances and behaviors really.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1952.7s	1952.7	 And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1957.5s	1957.5	 gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1972.0s	1972.0	 You're probably right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1976.2s	1976.2	 certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of waking.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1979.3s	1979.3	 And probably the last thoughts I have,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1981.2s	1981.2	 I would hope are not about work,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1984.3s	1984.3	 I do other things, but I have to actively turn that off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1988.5s	1988.5	 Yes, that's exactly right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1990.2s	1990.2	 And you're certainly not alone in that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1993.4s	1993.4	 At Stanford, no, no, no, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1994.3s	1994.3	 I mean, here in Silicon Valley, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1995.7s	1995.7	 It's highly rewarded, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=1998.0s	1998.0	 It's embedded in the culture here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2002.4s	2002.4	 I think it's called New York,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2003.5s	2003.5	 where they also work a lot here and it's heavily rewarded.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2008.6s	2008.6	 I once said, and I'm sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2011.0s	2011.0	 that I'm not the first person to say it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2012.7s	2012.7	 but I was thinking about addiction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2014.8s	2014.8	 and I was thinking about the underlying circuits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2017.2s	2017.2	 and I posted something to social media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2020.8s	2020.8	 which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2030.3s	2030.3	 and gave these amazing lectures
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2032.2s	2032.2	 in the neuroanatomy course for the medical students

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2042.1s	2042.1	 for that as well, which was a bit overstepping, I admit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2045.1s	2045.1	 which I said, addiction is a progressive narrowing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2060.1s	2060.1	 at the fact that nobody knows.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2061.4s	2061.4	 And so why not?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2066.5s	2066.5	 And people had very interesting conversations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2127.1s	2127.1	 I mean, and I understand the question as,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2129.9s	2129.9	 so what should we be striving for, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2132.3s	2132.3	 Where should we settle out?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2161.9s	2161.9	 I mean, it's many things, but in terms of dopamine,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2320.4s	2320.4	 can hang out together, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2343.5s	2343.5	 also we were talking about earlier

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2372.4s	2372.4	 let's say you had that list of all the things you hate to do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2939.7s	2939.7	 But I think that's really one of the keys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2941.8s	2941.8	 It's really taking it one day at a time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2943.5s	2943.5	 which your seals, and also this connecting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2947.5s	2947.5	 So being awake and alert to your environment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2950.5s	2950.5	 and connecting with your environment,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2952.3s	2952.3	 not trying to escape it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2956.6s	2956.6	 that experience of nonbeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2958.5s	2958.5	 And we get it from the internet or from drugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2960.9s	2960.9	 or whatever it is, but it's the booby prize
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2964.0s	2964.0	 because ultimately it takes you further and further away
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2967.5s	2967.5	 from your immediate environment,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2978.4s	2978.4	 that comes up again and again,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2987.7s	2987.7	 This actually came up in the discussion with Carl Deisseroth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2991.6s	2991.6	 who is also a successful scientist and clinician

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=2999.9s	2999.9	 and those stack up, as you mentioned.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3005.3s	3005.3	 that in order to reset the dopamine system,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3022.7s	3022.7	 Yeah, and 30 days is, in my clinical experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3025.9s	3025.9	 the average amount of time it takes for the brain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3036.8s	3036.8	 Some imaging studies showing that our brains are still

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3047.6s	3047.6	 which took a group of depressed men
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3051.2s	3051.2	 who also were addicted to alcohol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3053.7s	3053.7	 put them in a hospital where they had received no treatment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3058.0s	3058.0	 for depression, but they had no access
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3059.9s	3059.9	 to alcohol in that time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3061.2s	3061.2	 And after four weeks, 80% of them no longer met criteria
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3064.7s	3064.7	 for major depression.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3070.0s	3070.0	 of this high dopamine, high reward substance or behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3074.5s	3074.5	 we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3077.1s	3077.1	 for the balance to really equilibrate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3078.8s	3078.8	 And then we're in a place where we can enjoy other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3082.7s	3082.7	 So that progressive narrowing of what brings one pleasure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3086.1s	3086.1	 eventually expands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3087.5s	3087.5	 So I'd like to dissect out that 30 days a little more,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3090.8s	3090.8	 finally.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3092.4s	3092.4	 And I also want to address,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3095.4s	3095.4	 how does one stop doing something for 30 days
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3098.5s	3098.5	 if the thing is a thought?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3100.7s	3100.7	 So we'll kind of put that on the shelf for the moment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3103.9s	3103.9	 So days one through 10,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3107.2s	3107.2	 I would imagine will be very uncomfortable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3109.6s	3109.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3110.4s	3110.4	 They're going to suck, basically, to be quite honest,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3112.9s	3112.9	 because the way you describe this pleasure pain balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3117.4s	3117.4	 to my mind says that if you remove
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3120.3s	3120.3	 what little pleasure one is getting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3122.3s	3122.3	 or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3125.3s	3125.3	 that's gone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3126.3s	3126.3	 The pain system is really ramped up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3128.9s	3128.9	 and nothing is making me feel good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3131.7s	3131.7	 I'll just use myself as an example.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3133.3s	3133.3	 I'm not in recovery,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3135.6s	3135.6	 but that 10 days is going to be miserable.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3139.3s	3139.3	 Anxiety, trouble sleeping, physical agitation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3148.4s	3148.4	 Should one expect all of that?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3156.3s	3156.3	 and it's a really important piece of this intervention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3159.2s	3159.2	 is that you will feel worse before you feel better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3162.7s	3162.7	 For how long?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3163.6s	3163.6	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3165.0s	3165.0	 That's right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3169.1s	3169.1	 you'll feel worse for two weeks,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3173.6s	3173.6	 the sun will start to come out in week three,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3176.3s	3176.3	 and by week four, most people are feeling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3178.9s	3178.9	 a whole lot better than they were

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3187.3s	3187.3	 You have to sign up for it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=3815.3s	3815.3	 is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4126.9s	4126.9	 is that can we become addicted to sobriety?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4469.2s	4469.2	 Or just when I feel like I'm on the right path
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4473.1s	4473.1	 and I'm onto something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4474.2s	4474.2	 or if I see something that I'm excited about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4476.9s	4476.9	 I'm like, I feel filled with, it must be dopamine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4481.0s	4481.0	 I feel flooded with pleasure, literally from head to toe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4484.5s	4484.5	 And then my next thought is more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4486.5s	4486.5	 So true, you're a true addict.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4490.3s	4490.3	 You are. Thank you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4493.4s	4493.4	 you really got lucky with the fact that what you're drawn to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4498.9s	4498.9	 is adaptive, essentially.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4502.4s	4502.4	 And then your challenge is going to be
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4504.2s	4504.2	 that your life doesn't get too out of balance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4506.4s	4506.4	 in the sense that you're 24-7 working,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4509.3s	4509.3	 you don't stop and do some other things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4511.8s	4511.8	 or think of other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4512.7s	4512.7	 And my life admittedly is somewhat asymmetric.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4515.2s	4515.2	 I mean, it has other components of physical health, et cetera,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4517.3s	4517.3	 but it is somewhat asymmetric, which is why I got a dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4521.7s	4521.7	 Although I talk about him an awful lot.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4527.2s	4527.2	 and a little bit away from the work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4531.3s	4531.3	 who feel like they've never experienced addiction

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4534.6s	4534.6	 or if they do, they don't get it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4536.0s	4536.0	 Just think of that one thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4538.2s	4538.2	 that is the most important thing in your life
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4540.5s	4540.5	 that you do that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4543.7s	4543.7	 And then imagine if you couldn't do it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4546.1s	4546.1	 Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4547.7s	4547.7	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4551.4s	4551.4	 Well, I appreciate the feedback

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4561.3s	4561.3	 that you've ever witnessed

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4568.4s	4568.4	 Because I think we all know the standard heroin pill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4571.9s	4571.9	 You've been very, I should mention

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4584.0s	4584.0	 and turned out to be just as bad, if not worse,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4586.8s	4586.8	 than a lot of so-called street drugs.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4617.6s	4617.6	 for many years, but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4621.0s	4621.0	 or an urge to be drinking something a lot

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4639.6s	4639.6	 and so she would periodically intentionally overdose

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4845.4s	4845.4	 And yeah, tell us more about that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4852.5s	4852.5	 about working with people in recovery was how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4855.6s	4855.6	 telling the truth, even about the merest detail

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4867.7s	4867.7	 that when people are in their addiction

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4871.0s	4871.0	 so part of getting into recovery is to stop lying
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4874.9s	4874.9	 to the people they care about, about their use.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4879.3s	4879.3	 because what people in recovery have taught me is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4881.8s	4881.8	 that it's not even just not lying about using drugs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4885.6s	4885.6	 I have to not lie about anything.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4898.0s	4898.0	 Or just lying about, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4899.9s	4899.9	 I don't know where I had dinner.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4905.3s	4905.3	 where they're lying about random stuff

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4918.0s	4918.0	 in writing the book is sort of exploring the neuroscience

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4988.1s	4988.1	 Plus, just that being open and honest with people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4992.3s	4992.3	 really does create very intimate connections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=4996.6s	4996.6	 And those intimate connections create dopamine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5003.2s	5003.2	 a bunch of people who need intensity in their lives.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5011.1s	5011.1	 Like I'm really not interested in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5038.6s	5038.6	 But when I think it's right, I'm also transparent with them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5041.6s	5041.6	 So that's a source of dopamine too,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5044.0s	5044.0	 when we're honest and we disclose.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5067.4s	5067.4	 she's really opening up in this book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5069.5s	5069.5	 from the very beginning.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5071.7s	5071.7	 And I don't want to give it away,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5084.2s	5084.2	 I always think about like tell the truth,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5099.6s	5099.6	 And I'm fascinated by this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5101.1s	5101.1	 because to me telling the truth has many facets,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5103.5s	5103.5	 but the three sides of this thing in my mind are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5108.0s	5108.0	 one is reporting everything accurately.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5110.9s	5110.9	 The other is what do you withhold,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5112.6s	5112.6	 what do you not withhold, right?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5116.0s	5116.0	 tell the truth or at least don't lie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5126.3s	5126.3	 what I have to assume for most people is a small
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5129.2s	5129.2	 to enormous batch of things that they lied about

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5158.7s	5158.7	 all the stuff we've hidden and,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5162.2s	5162.2	 I mean, not me, but all the stuff

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5174.2s	5174.2	 a good number of those steps are about that very thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5177.6s	5177.6	 the past, the ways that we've harmed people in the past.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5180.9s	5180.9	 And the fourth step is about making amends,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5186.6s	5186.6	 by admitting the ways in which that we've contributed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5191.3s	5191.3	 to harming others.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5196.6s	5196.6	 So how important, so for people with addiction,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5200.0s	5200.0	 it's really, really important to go back and make amends.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5203.2s	5203.2	 And the key idea there is you just go back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5220.6s	5220.6	 in which we've harmed or lied to people in the past

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5587.5s	5587.5	 who are addicted to alcohol and then having them have this,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5611.1s	5611.1	 this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5619.3s	5619.3	 And clinical trials.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5628.8s	5628.8	 is there are many ways to the top of the mountain

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5656.5s	5656.5	 when it's beneficial is it just allows the person

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5663.8s	5663.8	 and look at their lives on a much broader sweep

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5675.1s	5675.1	 sort of details of their life,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5682.4s	5682.4	 in the vast universe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5687.9s	5687.9	 it's a transformational experience

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5700.1s	5700.1	 is positive and powerful because they can come back
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5703.1s	5703.1	 from that and be like, oh my gosh, I care about my family

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5715.4s	5715.4	 So it's almost like a spiritual or values-based.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5720.1s	5720.1	 So I think it can be very powerful,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5730.2s	5730.2	 It's hard for me to imagine that there's something

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5742.9s	5742.9	 psychotherapy as part of this thing, both got worse.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5746.7s	5746.7	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5748.3s	5748.3	 But the people I know who had severe trauma,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5751.8s	5751.8	 who did this, who took this approach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5753.9s	5753.9	 seem to be doing better.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5755.2s	5755.2	 Okay, interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5756.0s	5756.0	 And so I think that the discussion as we hear it now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5760.6s	5760.6	 is just sort of psychedelics, which is a huge category
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5763.8s	5763.8	 that includes many different drugs and compounds

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5771.5s	5771.5	 And I think that I'm a splitter, not a lumper,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5774.9s	5774.9	 as we say in science.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5893.8s	5893.8	 but those are controlled settings.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5900.5s	5900.5	 there are several papers published recently

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5918.5s	5918.5	 And so the experience of a psychedelic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5922.6s	5922.6	 and the long-term effects of the psychedelic

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5930.3s	5930.3	 I'm neither for something or against it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5938.5s	5938.5	 I agree with you and I can just tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5941.0s	5941.0	 that the downstream effect for the average person,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=5974.8s	5974.8	 Sure, and I'm gonna be sitting down with Matthew Johnson

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6075.3s	6075.3	 not necessarily eliminate this behavior.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6080.7s	6080.7	 And I wanna talk about what you've referred to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6083.7s	6083.7	 as this narcissistic preoccupation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6086.9s	6086.9	 that social media is creating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6088.8s	6088.8	 that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6093.6s	6093.6	 and how we sound and how we are being perceived
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6096.9s	6096.9	 than we were 10 years ago.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6103.7s	6103.7	 how addicting is it really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6106.0s	6106.0	 And what is healthy social media behavior?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6111.3s	6111.3	 So the first message I would wanna get across
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6116.5s	6116.5	 about social media is that it really is a drug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6120.2s	6120.2	 and it's engineered to be a drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6123.0s	6123.0	 And it's based on potency, quantity, variety,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6128.0s	6128.0	 the bottomless bowls, the likes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6130.3s	6130.3	 the way that it's enumerated, all of that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6132.9s	6132.9	 which doesn't mean that we can't use it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6136.3s	6136.3	 but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6139.5s	6139.5	 just like we need to be thoughtful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6140.9s	6140.9	 about the way we use any drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6144.8s	6144.8	 And so that means with intention and in advance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6148.6s	6148.6	 planning our use, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6150.8s	6150.8	 And trying to use it as a really awesome tool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6155.7s	6155.7	 to potentially connect with other people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6158.3s	6158.3	 and not to be used by it or get lost in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6163.1s	6163.1	 And of course, people are gonna come
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6165.5s	6165.5	 with different propensities for addiction to any drug,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6169.6s	6169.6	 and that's true for social media too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6171.1s	6171.1	 Some people will have no problem using it in moderation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6174.8s	6174.8	 or using it in a way that's adaptive,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6176.5s	6176.5	 and other people will immediately get sucked in.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6180.3s	6180.3	 And the key thing about getting addicted is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6182.3s	6182.3	 when it's happening, nobody who's getting addicted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6185.3s	6185.3	 thinks they're getting addicted, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6186.5s	6186.5	 Let's face it, it's only after the fact that we go,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6189.3s	6189.3	 whoops, what was that about?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6191.2s	6191.2	 Well, remember texting and driving?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6192.7s	6192.7	 There were all these books about texting and driving,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6194.5s	6194.5	 how terrible it was.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6196.4s	6196.4	 Even the governments have largely given up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6198.6s	6198.6	 You see these billboards, like don't text and drive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6201.7s	6201.7	 or any texts can wait or not worth dying for,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6204.6s	6204.6	 but everybody's texting and driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6206.0s	6206.0	 Right, and if you look at young people today, teenagers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6208.2s	6208.2	 I mean, they're basically cybernetically enhanced,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6210.6s	6210.6	 that the phone is there, it's like they're talking to you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6213.8s	6213.8	 and texting 12 friends at the same time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6216.4s	6216.4	 and there's no stopping it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6217.9s	6217.9	 I mean, the genie is out of the bottle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6219.4s	6219.4	 where it's not, we're not going back.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6222.5s	6222.5	 So we do need to figure out how to make this tool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6228.7s	6228.7	 something that's gonna be good for us

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6232.9s	6232.9	 And I don't have all the answers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6235.2s	6235.2	 by any stretch of the imagination,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6237.6s	6237.6	 but I do think some of the wisdom that we have learned
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6241.3s	6241.3	 from using other drugs also applies to social media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6245.2s	6245.2	 which is to say that we have to, again,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6247.8s	6247.8	 put barriers in place that allow us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6250.5s	6250.5	 to remain in control of our use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6252.4s	6252.4	 which means not too much, not too often, not too potent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6257.8s	6257.8	 Do you think in going back to this idea
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6259.5s	6259.5	 of the unit of the day being a good attractable unit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6263.5s	6263.5	 a manageable unit of time for most people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6266.8s	6266.8	 so you're saying in advance,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6267.9s	6267.9	 so allocating two hours in which you're going to allow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6272.3s	6272.3	 yourself to have free reign use of the phone

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6276.0s	6276.0	 or even more restricted than that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6278.5s	6278.5	 meaning, okay, I'm only gonna allow myself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6281.2s	6281.2	 30 minutes a day to post and comment,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6286.7s	6286.7	 Yeah, so I think it depends on the person
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6289.2s	6289.2	 and it's sort of a combination.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6367.0s	6367.0	 mature in years organism that can't control its behavior

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6373.4s	6373.4	 And there's neuroscience to support that statement.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6377.2s	6377.2	 I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6379.8s	6379.8	 and I think I'm a grown man.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6383.2s	6383.2	 Like, what is the problem here?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6386.6s	6386.6	 You know, I don't eat baby food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6388.2s	6388.2	 but I'm acting like a baby with the phone, all right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6391.6s	6391.6	 In the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6403.2s	6403.2	 30 days away from my phone?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6405.5s	6405.5	 full 30 days to reset.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6409.8s	6409.8	 I recommend the 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6411.0s	6411.0	 But if you're just a little bit addicted, like most of us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6414.1s	6414.1	 you probably don't need 30 days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6415.4s	6415.4	 In fact, a single day not only would be challenging,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6419.0s	6419.0	 but probably maybe sufficient.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6422.3s	6422.3	 My phone is off for substantial segments of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6425.4s	6425.4	 Okay, that's great.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6426.3s	6426.3	 And it drives other people crazy.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6428.0s	6428.0	 People expect me to respond, but I don't care.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6433.6s	6433.6	 I really don't. Yeah, right, right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6434.6s	6434.6	 And I actually take a little bit of pleasure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6436.9s	6436.9	 in the fact that, well, because I think the point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6439.1s	6439.1	 I'm trying to make is the right one,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6440.6s	6440.6	 which is that it's not just right for me, but like why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6444.0s	6444.0	 I don't see a clause on text messages or emails
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6447.6s	6447.6	 that say must be responded to within X amount of time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6451.8s	6451.8	 or else. Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6453.4s	6453.4	 Or else. Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6454.4s	6454.4	 So I take the liberty of replying when I'm able to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6458.3s	6458.3	 Yeah, that's right. Or want to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6459.8s	6459.8	 Yeah, right, but which touches on one of the big challenges
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6463.3s	6463.3	 about social media is that as more and more of us
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6466.7s	6466.7	 are spending more and more time on social media,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6469.2s	6469.2	 we're divesting our libidness energies, et cetera,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6473.2s	6473.2	 from real life interactions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6475.3s	6475.3	 So that means even when we want to choose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6478.2s	6478.2	 to not be online connecting, we go outside
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6481.2s	6481.2	 and there's no there there, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6482.9s	6482.9	 There's nobody else there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6484.8s	6484.8	 So I think our collective challenge,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6487.9s	6487.9	 and it should be our mission, is to make sure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6491.4s	6491.4	 that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6496.8s	6496.8	 to connect with each other.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6498.5s	6498.5	 Because if we don't do that, then we'll be very lonely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6501.2s	6501.2	 right, if we were not online.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6504.0s	6504.0	 But if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6508.0s	6508.0	 none of whom are on their phones while you're together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6511.7s	6511.7	 for that discrete amount of time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6513.0s	6513.0	 then it's wonderful and liberating and nobody's distracted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6516.3s	6516.3	 And I think that's really the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6519.0s	6519.0	 And I think young people are figuring that out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6521.9s	6521.9	 They're trying to create these spaces or try to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6524.5s	6524.5	 let's say instead of doing a dopamine fast by yourself,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6527.2s	6527.2	 do it with your friends, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6529.1s	6529.1	 Then there's the FOMO is less, the fear of missing out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6531.8s	6531.8	 because, oh, you're all doing the dopamine fast together.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6534.6s	6534.6	 So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6537.6s	6537.6	 But- I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6538.4s	6538.4	 Yeah, okay, good. I like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6539.4s	6539.4	 I don't allow, I have a home gym and I love working out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6542.8s	6542.8	 I just enjoy it and I always have.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6544.6s	6544.6	 And I don't allow my phone in my gym anymore.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6549.1s	6549.1	 I live in an area where I don't get any reception,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6551.2s	6551.2	 like two meters outside my door.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6553.1s	6553.1	 So all my dog walks now are just with the dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6555.2s	6555.2	 And they were boring as hell.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6556.6s	6556.6	 I also have a bulldog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6557.5s	6557.5	 He doesn't like to walk, it's really slow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6560.8s	6560.8	 And it was so boring for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6563.2s	6563.2	 Because I was so used to taking calls while I walk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6565.3s	6565.3	 and it's super efficient when I do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6568.6s	6568.6	 The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6572.3s	6572.3	 because, and if the phone were,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6574.1s	6574.1	 if I were to get a call on one of those
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6575.7s	6575.7	 and they brought reception to the area,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6577.0s	6577.0	 I would be very dismayed.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6578.8s	6578.8	 So I can attest to this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6579.9s	6579.9	 And I don't think I'm a phone addict,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6583.5s	6583.5	 but I do put work into regulating my phone behavior.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6586.9s	6586.9	 Yeah, so this is the key.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6588.1s	6588.1	 You have to, with intention,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=6590.2s	6590.2	 prior to being in that situation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7130.6s	7130.6	 Well, it's awesome, but I have to say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7132.6s	7132.6	 I have been surprised by your generosity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7142.0s	7142.0	 which is a wonderful place,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7149.2s	7149.2	 to somebody else, I've lost something,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7156.1s	7156.1	 which is not the right way to think about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7158.4s	7158.4	 not how you are, and also not how the world works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7161.6s	7161.6	 Because when we give away to other people,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7164.2s	7164.2	 we get back so much more, but it takes a long time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7169.5s	7169.5	 and it might not come through that path.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7172.0s	7172.0	 I never think about reciprocity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7175.0s	7175.0	 but I was weaned by good advisors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7178.8s	7178.8	 That's very nice.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7181.8s	7181.8	 that the more you give, the better your immediate life is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7185.6s	7185.6	 Yes, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7186.4s	7186.4	 But I also don't have a long-term vision.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7191.5s	7191.5	 I'm just excited about the book.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7192.8s	7192.8	 I'm excited that people are learning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7195.4s	7195.4	 about the brain and dopamine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7197.5s	7197.5	 I have to admit, having grown up in neuroscience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7200.5s	7200.5	 essentially, I did not understand that pleasure and pain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7203.0s	7203.0	 were orchestrated the way that they are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7205.4s	7205.4	 I'm very mindful of it now.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7207.2s	7207.2	 Oh, good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7208.1s	7208.1	 And it's changed a number of my behaviors.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7210.8s	7210.8	 I know a number of people are going to have questions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7212.6s	7212.6	 and want to get in contact with you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7216.2s	7216.2	 That's correct, yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7217.4s	7217.4	 You are true to your ideology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7223.0s	7223.0	 I wouldn't be able to control myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7225.1s	7225.1	 I mean, that really would be my drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7227.0s	7227.0	 People are my drug.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7228.3s	7228.3	 Intimacy is my drug, and I wouldn't be able to manage it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7232.0s	7232.0	 And so it was just easier for me to not do it at all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7235.5s	7235.5	 rather than try to moderate it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7237.2s	7237.2	 Well, the book, as you mentioned before,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3JLaF_4Tz8&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=102&pp=iAQB&t=7242.3s	7242.3	 People get to know you through the book.
