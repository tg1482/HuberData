https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=366.7s	366.7	 that you have been involved in human performance

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=373.9s	373.9	 You are obviously very involved in MMA now

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=385.0s	385.0	 what exactly was the PhD in?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=386.9s	386.9	 It was exercise physiology.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=388.2s	388.2	 Exercise physiology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=391.5s	391.5	 control groups, all the sorts of things that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=394.3s	394.3	 in my opinion anyway, are kind of lacking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=396.3s	396.3	 from the internet social media version of exercise science,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=401.7s	401.7	 which is that people throw out all sorts of ideas
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=403.7s	403.7	 about how people should be training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=405.0s	405.0	 what they should be doing and eating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=406.6s	406.6	 and not eating and doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=408.2s	408.2	 And certainly science doesn't have all the answers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=410.7s	410.7	 but I just think it's so rare to find somebody
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=412.8s	412.8	 that's at the convergence of all those different fields.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=416.9s	416.9	 And so I have a lot of questions for you today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=418.9s	418.9	 that I'm sure the audience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=420.3s	420.3	 are going to be really interested in it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=421.7s	421.7	 Well, listen, I mean, I appreciate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=423.5s	423.5	 It's very humbling and yeah,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=424.9s	424.9	 I've worked hard to get to where I am,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=427.3s	427.3	 but I've always tried to be authentic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=429.0s	429.0	 And I think authenticity comes alongside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=432.5s	432.5	 you know, academic rigor and objectivity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=435.5s	435.5	 and insight and knowledge base, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=438.1s	438.1	 At the end of the day, it's about having confidence,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=440.9s	440.9	 having expertise and being able to deliver that expertise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=443.6s	443.6	 to, in my world, to athletes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=446.5s	446.5	 And I think that's what I've always tried to do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=448.8s	448.8	 I've tried to have many strings to my bow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=451.9s	451.9	 so that I can talk with many different hats on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=454.7s	454.7	 but one day I'm talking to a coach,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=456.0s	456.0	 the next day I'm talking to an athlete,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=457.2s	457.2	 the next day I'm talking to a CEO,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=458.8s	458.8	 the next day I'm talking to an academic professor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=462.4s	462.4	 So I think being able to wear those different hats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=465.6s	465.6	 is certainly a skillset that I've tried to build
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=468.5s	468.5	 throughout my career.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=471.9s	471.9	 I think it was 36 different professional or Olympic sports
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=475.1s	475.1	 last time I counted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=476.7s	476.7	 So yeah, it's been a wild ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=478.9s	478.9	 It's been great.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=482.7s	482.7	 I've worked with crown green bowling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=485.6s	485.6	 which I don't know, as an American guy,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=487.1s	487.1	 I don't know how well you know that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=488.9s	488.9	 I've never heard of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=489.8s	489.8	 Basically imagine a 20 foot by 20 foot square of turf

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=744.1s	744.1	 It's mechanical stress and it's metabolic stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=746.2s	746.2	 And these are, you know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=754.1s	754.1	 You know, my work primarily looked at, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=758.0s	758.0	 catecholamines and sympathetic arousal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=762.7s	762.7	 Correct, yeah, epinephrine, adrenaline,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=765.3s	765.3	 you know, noradrenaline,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=769.3s	769.3	 signaling cascade using, you know, the HPA axis,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=775.3s	775.3	 looking at how that also influenced the adrenal medulla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=778.5s	778.5	 to release, you know, androgens,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=783.0s	783.0	 That raises an interesting question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=784.4s	784.4	 So in presumably weight training in women,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=788.0s	788.0	 people who don't have testes,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=792.2s	792.2	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=793.0s	793.0	 And is that purely through the adrenals?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=794.1s	794.1	 When women lift weights,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=795.1s	795.1	 their adrenal glands release testosterone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=796.8s	796.8	 Absolutely.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=800.4s	800.4	 for females.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=801.4s	801.4	 And yes, it's the same downstream cascade.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=803.5s	803.5	 Obviously the extent to which it happens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=805.3s	805.3	 is significantly less in females,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=807.3s	807.3	 but that's how you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=808.1s	808.1	 there's good data out there that shows, you know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=813.3s	813.3	 their internal anabolic milieu,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=820.6s	820.6	 you know, whether it's tendon, ligament, adaptations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=823.2s	823.2	 you know, the beneficial consequences of resistance training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=826.3s	826.3	 which is driven by anabolic stimuli.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=830.3s	830.3	 The first one is something that you mentioned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=831.8s	831.8	 which is that the androgens,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=834.6s	834.6	 the testosterone comes from the adrenals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=836.3s	836.3	 under resistance loads.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=840.1s	840.1	 I mean, we hear that the testes produce testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=842.4s	842.4	 when we weight train for men that have testes,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=850.7s	850.7	 or the testes in men that are increasing testosterone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=853.1s	853.1	 Yeah, I think- More or both?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=854.0s	854.0	 A little bit from each?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=855.9s	855.9	 The field is divided presently

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=864.5s	864.5	 in terms of, you know, anabolic response to exercise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=867.9s	867.9	 in an acute phase and the exposure to, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=871.4s	871.4	 a stimulus that is stress-driven,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=875.3s	875.3	 partly from the gonads,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=876.6s	876.6	 versus a longitudinal exposure to anabolic environments,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=881.5s	881.5	 which is primarily driven by obviously the gonads
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=885.7s	885.7	 and the endocrine environment

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=891.9s	891.9	 is promoting hypertrophy, you know, muscle tissue growth,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=895.7s	895.7	 and whether that is very much an adrenal stimuli,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=900.3s	900.3	 or if that's significant enough in these acute responses
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=903.0s	903.0	 versus the longitudinal exposure,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=911.9s	911.9	 like with most things, it's probably both.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=915.7s	915.7	 And then you mentioned that testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=917.9s	917.9	 can have enhancing effects, growth effects

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=922.7s	922.7	 You don't often hear about that.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=934.5s	934.5	 Absolutely, I mean, I think, you know,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1006.0s	1006.0	 but once they're doing that, I mean,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1008.0s	1008.0	 I've heard shorter sessions are better than longer sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1010.9s	1010.9	 but in rep loads, there's a lot of parameter space,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1014.1s	1014.1	 but if you were going to throw out some of the parameters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1017.8s	1017.8	 that you think are most important to pay attention to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1020.4s	1020.4	 for the typical person who's trying to use weight training
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1023.3s	1023.3	 to build or maintain muscle, lose body fat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1027.1s	1027.1	 so body recomposition and or stay strong and healthy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1030.8s	1030.8	 for sport of a different kind.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1032.6s	1032.6	 Yeah, so the work that we obviously, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1034.5s	1034.5	 I was exposed to back in my PhD,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1037.5s	1037.5	 it was a double-edged sword,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1038.9s	1038.9	 and as much as testosterone is really stimulated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1041.1s	1041.1	 by an intensity factor and also a volume factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1044.4s	1044.4	 Now growth hormone is a little bit different,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1046.1s	1046.1	 that's largely driven by an intensity factor alone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1048.6s	1048.6	 Oh, really?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1049.5s	1049.5	 I always thought that growth hormone was driven by volume,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1051.6s	1051.6	 which just goes to show you-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1052.6s	1052.6	 Maybe I've got the wrong answer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1053.4s	1053.4	 No, no, no, no, I think you're probably right,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1054.5s	1054.5	 which just goes to show you that most of what's out there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1056.5s	1056.5	 on the internet is completely-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1058.9s	1058.9	 Not only is it wrong, it's usually backwards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1061.4s	1061.4	 So no, trust your instinct,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1064.3s	1064.3	 because I think people just make this stuff up, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1067.9s	1067.9	 Because it's very hard to measure growth hormone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1069.9s	1069.9	 and testosterone, and I can't imagine most of the stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1074.3s	1074.3	 that I see out there, they're taking drips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1076.0s	1076.0	 and measuring free versus bound and all this kind of stuff,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1079.7s	1079.7	 but that's what you do in laboratories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1081.1s	1081.1	 Right, yeah, you look at total composition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1083.4s	1083.4	 then you look at how much of that is free-circulating
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1085.5s	1085.5	 in the system, how much is bound,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1087.0s	1087.0	 and therefore biologically active,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1089.1s	1089.1	 bound to receptor creating adaptation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1092.0s	1092.0	 But yeah, coming back to testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1093.7s	1093.7	 in terms of the training strategies,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1095.7s	1095.7	 it's largely driven by both an intensity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1098.0s	1098.0	 and a volume factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1099.2s	1099.2	 So if you look at many of the exercise interventions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1102.6s	1102.6	 that we use to try and investigate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1104.3s	1104.3	 and interrogate testosterone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1106.5s	1106.5	 it was usually a six by 10 protocol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1110.6s	1110.6	 So you touch in-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1111.9s	1111.9	 Six by 10 meaning?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1113.1s	1113.1	 Yeah, six sets of 10 repetitions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1115.5s	1115.5	 which is quite a large, 60 repetitions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1118.4s	1118.4	 is quite a large volume for a single exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1121.5s	1121.5	 and that was usually pitched at about 80%
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1123.9s	1123.9	 of a one repetition max intensity.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1125.9s	1125.9	 Okay, so 80% of the one rep max,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1127.9s	1127.9	 six sets of 10 reps separated by rest of-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1131.7s	1131.7	 Two minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1132.5s	1132.5	 Two minutes, which is actually pretty fast,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1134.3s	1134.3	 at least to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1135.1s	1135.1	 Anytime you see these two to three minutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1136.7s	1136.7	 when you're actually watching the clock,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1138.5s	1138.5	 those two minute rest periods go by pretty fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1140.6s	1140.6	 By the third, fourth set, you're dying for more, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1143.9s	1143.9	 And I think we formulated that kind of exercise protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1147.5s	1147.5	 to really target the release of testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1151.3s	1151.3	 and try and drive up these anabolic environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1153.5s	1153.5	 to study the endocrine consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 But I think that's the type of protocol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1160.3s	1160.3	 that is most advantageous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1162.7s	1162.7	 for driving anabolic environments.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1164.5s	1164.5	 And that was it for the workout?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1166.3s	1166.3	 Yeah, I mean, we would do that in a back squat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1168.2s	1168.2	 So multi-joint, challenging exercise,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1172.3s	1172.3	 multi-muscle, multi-joint, 80% load
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1175.6s	1175.6	 of your one repetition max and then six by 10.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1178.1s	1178.1	 We did play around with your classic German volume type,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1181.1s	1181.1	 10 by 10 kind of protocols,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1184.7s	1184.7	 but they were just unsustainable at that 80%.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1187.7s	1187.7	 The key to what we also did was we always adjusted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1191.2s	1191.2	 the loads to make sure that it was 10 repetitions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1194.6s	1194.6	 that were sustained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1195.7s	1195.7	 So if the load was too high and an athlete or a participant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1200.2s	1200.2	 had to drop the weights on the six repetition,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1203.3s	1203.3	 we would unload the bar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1204.5s	1204.5	 and make sure they completed the 10 repetitions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1206.7s	1206.7	 Bringing me back to the point of it's an intensity
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1209.0s	1209.0	 and a volume derivative that is gonna be most advantageous
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1212.8s	1212.8	 for testosterone release.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1214.0s	1214.0	 That's really interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1214.9s	1214.9	 And one thing that you mentioned there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1216.2s	1216.2	 is especially interesting to me, which is you said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1218.4s	1218.4	 when you go from six sets of 10 repetitions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1221.7s	1221.7	 to 10 sets of 10 repetitions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1224.7s	1224.7	 it's not as beneficial and might even be counterproductive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1227.6s	1227.6	 But to me, the difference between six and 10 sets
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1231.1s	1231.1	 is only four sets.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1231.9s	1231.9	 It doesn't even sound that much.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1232.8s	1232.8	 So that sort of hints at the possibility
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1234.3s	1234.3	 that the thresholds for going from a workout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1237.5s	1237.5	 that increases testosterone to a workout
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1239.5s	1239.5	 that diminishes testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1241.3s	1241.3	 is actually a pretty narrow margin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1243.1s	1243.1	 Yeah, and I think it comes back to that intensity factor then.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1584.5s	1584.5	 they're eating a ton of protein,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1599.2s	1599.2	 Interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1602.8s	1602.8	 because I know the audience likes to try protocols.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1610.1s	1610.1	 What about day-to-day recovery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1611.5s	1611.5	 I mean, can the workout that you described is intense,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1616.8s	1616.8	 do that and sustain progress?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1619.3s	1619.3	 Yeah, I mean, I think that comes back to your training age
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1621.5s	1621.5	 and your training history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1622.4s	1622.4	 Obviously there's a resilience and a robustness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1624.5s	1624.5	 with an incremental training age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1626.7s	1626.7	 So, that's not a protocol that I would advise anyone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1629.9s	1629.9	 to go out and start tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1632.2s	1632.2	 They'll be mopping them off the gym floor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1636.3s	1636.3	 So 80%, you know, if you're maximum at a young training age,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1640.3s	1640.3	 you're still 80% versus, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1642.3s	1642.3	 I've been training 10 years, it's still 80%.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1647.3s	1647.3	 It's just more tonnage, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1649.8s	1649.8	 But yeah, I think a protocol like that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1651.8s	1651.8	 we would look at two times a week,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1654.0s	1654.0	 something that's pretty intensive like that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1656.2s	1656.2	 Because again, it comes back to the point you make,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1658.1s	1658.1	 is that you really need to be, for want of better terms,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1661.4s	1661.4	 suffering a little bit through that type of protocol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1664.0s	1664.0	 both in terms of the challenge of the load,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1666.7s	1666.7	 but also being able to tolerate the metabolic stress
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1670.0s	1670.0	 that you're exposed to.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1670.9s	1670.9	 It's a bit of a sicko feeling, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1674.8s	1674.8	 Because of the lactate that you're driving up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1676.6s	1676.6	 So, I wouldn't promote an athlete doing that type of modality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1681.3s	1681.3	 you know, multiple, multiple times,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1687.7s	1687.7	 of what you're trying to achieve.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1698.7s	1698.7	 Muscle growth is a conduit to increase strength,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1702.2s	1702.2	 increase power, increase speed, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1705.0s	1705.0	 So yes, trying to get bigger cross-sectional area
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1707.5s	1707.5	 of a muscle means that we can produce more force
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1709.5s	1709.5	 into the ground, or wherever it may be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1711.6s	1711.6	 if we're a locomotive athlete.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1713.2s	1713.2	 But usually, sportsmen and women
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1715.5s	1715.5	 are not just purely seeking muscle growth.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1719.0s	1719.0	 They look for different facets of muscle endurance,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1792.2s	1792.2	 that in the short term, a big increase in stress hormone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1796.7s	1796.7	 can lead to an increase in testosterone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1798.7s	1798.7	 like a parachute jump.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1806.9s	1806.9	 That was news to me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1808.9s	1808.9	 We always hear about stress suppressing testosterone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1811.3s	1811.3	 stress suppressing the immune system,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1815.5s	1815.5	 you're saying it can actually increase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1817.3s	1817.3	 the release of testosterone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1821.0s	1821.0	 Correct, yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1822.2s	1822.2	 And so then the second question is,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1824.7s	1824.7	 does my cognitive interpretation of the stressor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1829.3s	1829.3	 make a difference?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1830.8s	1830.8	 In other words, if I voluntarily jump out of a plane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1833.2s	1833.2	 with a parachute, does it have a different effect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1836.2s	1836.2	 on my testosterone than if you shove me out of the plane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1839.3s	1839.3	 against my will, or presumably with a parachute too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1842.6s	1842.6	 I mean, so this was what all my PhD work was looking at,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1846.7s	1846.7	 was the exposure to a stressor and the pre-arousal
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1855.4s	1855.4	 of how your body essentially prepares for that stressor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1857.6s	1857.6	 and then how it manages it throughout the exposure
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1860.5s	1860.5	 to the stress.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1861.3s	1861.3	 And it was actually motivated from parachute jumpers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1863.7s	1863.7	 There was an older study looking at parachute jumpers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1866.8s	1866.8	 into combat and then they were studying the cortisol,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1871.6s	1871.6	 the stress response and the epinephrine response

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1874.9s	1874.9	 So we got us thinking about, hold on,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1877.4s	1877.4	 there's certain workouts that you do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1878.8s	1878.8	 that are just the daunting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1880.5s	1880.5	 It's like, okay, it's squat Saturday or whatever it may be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1884.3s	1884.3	 Oh my gosh, this is gonna destroy me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1901.2s	1901.2	 that these athletes knew was going to be very,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1908.4s	1908.4	 They knew there were gonna be some physical distress

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1914.3s	1914.3	 of how they were gonna approach that was already set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1916.8s	1916.8	 So what we saw prior, 15 minutes prior to the start
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1920.5s	1920.5	 of an exposure to the workout,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1923.1s	1923.1	 the epinephrine, the neuroadrenaline,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1964.1s	1964.1	 So force output throughout the workout was intimately linked.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=1968.0s	1968.0	 So what was the takeaway there?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2008.7s	2008.7	 as I'll just say, as a buffer to the answer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2011.5s	2011.5	 you're about to give, that there's very little science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2015.2s	2015.2	 around flow and there's very little neuroscience
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2018.4s	2018.4	 related to most psychological states anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2022.5s	2022.5	 All right, I can breathe easy.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2035.0s	2035.0	 the greater the arousal, the higher the performance was

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2042.0s	2042.0	 of some of my findings,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2043.0s	2043.0	 where there's definitely an individual biokinetics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2045.9s	2045.9	 to some of these hormonal kind of releases.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2053.0s	2053.0	 adrenergic response in terms of epinephrine release,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2055.4s	2055.4	 norepinephrine release, also sustained force output

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2063.6s	2063.6	 So the individuals that had a lower stimulus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2068.0s	2068.0	 of the sympathetic arousal, let's say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2070.4s	2070.4	 certainly didn't perform as well throughout the workout.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2072.9s	2072.9	 Now the intriguing thing then becomes is, okay,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2075.9s	2075.9	 and I think this really segues into what we're doing here
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2080.1s	2080.1	 with combat athletes, with mixed martial artists.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2085.9s	2085.9	 in terms of the exposure, repeat exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2088.6s	2088.6	 The more you do that challenging workout,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2090.7s	2090.7	 do you get the same psychological stimulus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2094.0s	2094.0	 Do you still get the same stress response?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2096.1s	2096.1	 And the assumption is unlikely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2098.9s	2098.9	 You accommodate, you become accustomed to the stressor,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2101.8s	2101.8	 your body will therefore adapt,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2103.2s	2103.2	 and that's the classic overload principle, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2105.9s	2105.9	 You then need to take the stressor down a different route.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2108.3s	2108.3	 But I think when you look at the athletes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2112.0s	2112.0	 that we work with here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2113.9s	2113.9	 it's a fist fight at the end of the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2116.1s	2116.1	 There's nothing more stressful than that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2117.7s	2117.7	 But I think just the exposure to the rigors of training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2121.0s	2121.0	 to understand the bad positions, the bad situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2124.7s	2124.7	 to know that they can get out of certain situations,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2127.1s	2127.1	 out of certain submission holes or whatever it may be.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2134.2s	2134.2	 in terms of what these guys do to approach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2136.7s	2136.7	 what is really challenging sport and arena
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2139.2s	2139.2	 in mixed martial arts.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2143.5s	2143.5	 in terms of asking, does stress favor or hinder performance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2148.6s	2148.6	 Yeah, like you said, at the end of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2150.0s	2150.0	 it's someone trying to hurt you as much as they possibly can
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2153.9s	2153.9	 within the bounds of the rules,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2155.1s	2155.1	 and you're trying to do the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2156.6s	2156.6	 So I find that your thesis work fascinating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2160.6s	2160.6	 Were you never to be at the UFC Performance Institute,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2164.5s	2164.5	 luckily they made the right choice and brought you here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2167.7s	2167.7	 But were you never to come here,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2169.5s	2169.5	 I was still fascinated by this because over and over
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2173.3s	2173.3	 we hear that stress is bad, stress is bad, stress is bad.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2176.5s	2176.5	 But everything I read from the scientific literature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2178.9s	2178.9	 is that stress and epinephrine in particular
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2182.8s	2182.8	 is coupled to the testosterone response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2184.9s	2184.9	 to performance and to adaptation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2187.1s	2187.1	 provided it doesn't go on too long.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2189.9s	2189.9	 So unless I'm saying something that violates that,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2193.1s	2193.1	 I mean, that's your work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2194.5s	2194.5	 so it's really important and beautiful work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2197.4s	2197.4	 and I refer to it often, so I'm just glad that I've,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2200.7s	2200.7	 thank you. We could bolt that down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2202.7s	2202.7	 because I think the people need to know this,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2205.9s	2205.9	 that discomfort is beneficial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2208.4s	2208.4	 Now there's another side to this that I want to ask about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2211.9s	2211.9	 which is the use of cold,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2215.8s	2215.8	 in particular things like ice baths, cold showers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2218.5s	2218.5	 or any other type of cold temperature exposure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2225.5s	2225.5	 In theory, that stress also, it's epinephrine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2228.6s	2228.6	 And so how should one think about the use of cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2232.8s	2232.8	 for recovery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2234.3s	2234.3	 So if it's stress, if colds causes stress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2238.7s	2238.7	 then how is cold used for recovery?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2241.8s	2241.8	 That's what I don't understand,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2243.1s	2243.1	 and maybe you just want to share your thoughts on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2245.9s	2245.9	 Yeah, no, and I think it's a great question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2249.0s	2249.0	 and I think the jury is still out there, certainly,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2252.2s	2252.2	 knowing some of the conversations that we've been having.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2254.4s	2254.4	 But I think when we talk about stress,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2256.2s	2256.2	 it's your classic fight, flight, or freeze approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2260.2s	2260.2	 And throwing your body into a cold tub,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2263.7s	2263.7	 an ice bath, or whatever it may be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2266.1s	2266.1	 certainly is gonna have a physiological stress response.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2269.3s	2269.3	 Now, people are using that for different end goals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2273.0s	2273.0	 And again, I think that's where the narrative
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2274.8s	2274.8	 has to be explained.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2276.8s	2276.8	 If you are using the stress specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2279.3s	2279.3	 to manage the mindset,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2282.0s	2282.0	 to use it as a specific stress stimulus,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2284.8s	2284.8	 that's the same as me doing six by 10, 80%.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2581.4s	2581.4	 a little bit to allow it to its natural healing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2587.6s	2587.6	 Well, you don't want to negate that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2589.5s	2589.5	 You want the body to optimize its internal recovery

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2594.1s	2594.1	 So interesting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2620.3s	2620.3	 of cold exposure for recovery ice bath.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2623.1s	2623.1	 Everyone wants to jump in an ice bath.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2627.9s	2627.9	 have started to say, have started to figure out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2630.3s	2630.3	 and look at some of the data,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2632.3s	2632.3	 we're now more intuitive about, well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2634.8s	2634.8	 actually that might not be the best
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2636.2s	2636.2	 or the most optimal approach.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2637.6s	2637.6	 And I think that's any given sport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2639.7s	2639.7	 So yes, certainly here at the UFC,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2641.8s	2641.8	 we're trying to educate our athletes around

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2646.1s	2646.1	 And it's the same with nutrition.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2647.5s	2647.5	 It's the same with an ice bath intervention.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2649.7s	2649.7	 It's the same with lifting weights.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2651.3s	2651.3	 It's the same with going for a run
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2652.6s	2652.6	 or working out on the bike.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2662.4s	2662.4	 we have to have a consideration around that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2664.5s	2664.5	 But it's not just MMA fighters.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2672.2s	2672.2	 the most successful professionals do that really well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2678.7s	2678.7	 and then they build structure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2680.3s	2680.3	 And I think, at the most elite level,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2682.8s	2682.8	 we always talk about it here at the UFC,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2700.6s	2700.6	 and sustain a technical output for skill development.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2703.7s	2703.7	 Therefore, their skills can improve or physical development.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2706.2s	2706.2	 Their physical attributes can improve.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2711.5s	2711.5	 falls into a recovery conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2714.6s	2714.6	 Now, when is the right time to use something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2716.5s	2716.5	 like an ice bath and when isn't

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2741.2s	2741.2	 it's truly a decathlon of combat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2745.1s	2745.1	 whether it's a grappling, whether it's a wrestling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2746.9s	2746.9	 whether it's the transition work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2748.2s	2748.2	 whether it's the standup striking.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2753.9s	2753.9	 are significantly large compared to something like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2757.6s	2757.6	 you know, a wide receiver in football.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2779.8s	2779.8	 is one of the biggest challenges of mixed martial arts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2782.6s	2782.6	 And the best guys get that right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2788.5s	2788.5	 And remember, why are we doing training?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2790.3s	2790.3	 We're doing training for technical and tactical improvement.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2878.3s	2878.3	 It's a quality driven exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2952.7s	2952.7	 I would say, yes, it's shorter sessions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2979.2s	2979.2	 if we just do lots of 30 minute sessions,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2982.4s	2982.4	 we've got to do a lot of 30 minute sessions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2984.4s	2984.4	 to get the volume exposure of the repetition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2987.7s	2987.7	 and the rehearsal of the skill again and again and again.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=2997.8s	2997.8	 we'll take the 90 minute session any day

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3018.8s	3018.8	 Yeah, there really does seem to be something to it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3021.5s	3021.5	 And I've wondered, is it depletion of adrenaline, dopamine?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3026.5s	3026.5	 I sometimes think it might be dopamine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3035.9s	3035.9	 oftentimes the brain just doesn't want

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3083.8s	3083.8	 quite as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3087.4s	3087.4	 and I think there's a, coming back to this kind of stress consideration,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3091.9s	3091.9	 you know, like a public speaking or taking an exam.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3098.5s	3098.5	 in a particular way, it's challenging.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3100.5s	3100.5	 There's a strain related to it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3118.1s	3118.1	 you know, that reward center in the brain,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3135.2s	3135.2	 actually the strategy around how you fuel for learning

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3147.4s	3147.4	 So, you know, are you fueling accordingly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3150.2s	3150.2	 around your training sessions?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3155.6s	3155.6	 and I'm going to bang out, you know, 15 sprints,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3159.3s	3159.3	 max effort, and I'm going to, you know, be dropping off

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3167.1s	3167.1	 in a very demanding exercise or drilling session

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3180.7s	3180.7	 And I think that's obviously, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3182.7s	3182.7	 might be an area where athletes do themselves a disservice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3185.6s	3185.6	 by not appropriately fueling

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3190.8s	3190.8	 but the cognitive challenge has been significantly high.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3195.2s	3195.2	 So they're doing skill work or drill work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3197.3s	3197.3	 and it's taxing the brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3199.2s	3199.2	 Correct.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3199.5s	3199.5	 They're thinking, oh, you know, I wasn't, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3202.0s	3202.0	 pushing hard lifts or doing sprints,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3348.3s	3348.3	 the characteristics of our sport,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3350.9s	3350.9	 Can I interrupt you real quick?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3352.2s	3352.2	 What about ketones for people that are ingesting carbohydrates?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3356.5s	3356.5	 This is an interesting area

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3359.5s	3359.5	 oh, I have to be ketogenic to benefit from taking ketones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3362.8s	3362.8	 But there are a number of athletes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3364.1s	3364.1	 and recreational athletes now as well,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3367.3s	3367.3	 taking liquid or powder-based ketones

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3374.2s	3374.2	 and other things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3375.8s	3375.8	 So are there any known benefits of ketones
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3379.1s	3379.1	 even if one is not in a state of ketosis?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3389.1s	3389.1	 in our sport is after the event,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3391.2s	3391.2	 in terms of the brain health with athletes

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3396.3s	3396.3	 and looking to maintain the fueling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3399.0s	3399.0	 and the energy supply to the brain.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3400.8s	3400.8	 But yes, it's probably a little bit out of my remit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3403.1s	3403.1	 so I don't want to talk on that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3404.9s	3404.9	 because I'm not fully familiar with that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3406.7s	3406.7	 Well, I've heard that ketones after head injury
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3409.7s	3409.7	 can provide a buffering component.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3411.6s	3411.6	 It's not going to reverse brain damage,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3413.3s	3413.3	 but it might be able to offset some of the micro damage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3416.0s	3416.0	 Right. So that's how we use it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3418.2s	3418.2	 just to sustain the energy supply to the brain
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3421.9s	3421.9	 that might be compromised through brain trauma.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3424.8s	3424.8	 So that's why we use ketones.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3427.4s	3427.4	 To come back to the original question,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3428.7s	3428.7	 if it's a general population, then yes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3431.3s	3431.3	 I think there's a place to argue that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3433.5s	3433.5	 actually being on a ketogenic diet at times,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3437.9s	3437.9	 maybe not, I don't mean cycling a bike,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3440.1s	3440.1	 cycling ketosis is beneficial

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3445.1s	3445.1	 to better metabolic management and metabolic efficiency.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3449.0s	3449.0	 Those lower intensities where we should be fueling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3452.2s	3452.2	 our metabolism with lipids and fats,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3459.2s	3459.2	 is heavily driven by processed foods and carbohydrates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3462.7s	3462.7	 that people become predisposed to utilization
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3465.7s	3465.7	 of that fuel source above lipids use, fat use,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3471.1s	3471.1	 intensities that are very low.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3472.6s	3472.6	 So some of our data with the fighters shows that as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3476.3s	3476.3	 But I think the challenge for us is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3478.5s	3478.5	 we're working with a clientele

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3486.9s	3486.9	 Now we use tactics here where we essentially
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3490.7s	3490.7	 have athletes on what you would say kind of a,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3493.5s	3493.5	 is it largely a ketogenic diet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3496.3s	3496.3	 but then we will fuel carbohydrates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3498.5s	3498.5	 around training sessions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3503.5s	3503.5	 So it's not- Post-training.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3852.6s	3852.6	 I think the listeners of my podcast generally are experimenters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3857.3s	3857.3	 They are scientists of themselves,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3858.8s	3858.8	 which makes me happy, obviously.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3862.2s	3862.2	 And I like to think that they're paying attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3863.9s	3863.9	 to the changes they're making
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3865.5s	3865.5	 and how they're affecting themselves.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3867.9s	3867.9	 They seem more open to trying things,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3870.9s	3870.9	 provided they can do it safely,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3873.3s	3873.3	 and seeing what works for them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3875.8s	3875.8	 I'm certainly going to try some of the change up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3877.9s	3877.9	 I also am really a creature of habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3880.0s	3880.0	 And I think talking to you today,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3881.8s	3881.8	 I realize I'm probably doing a number of things truly wrong in my training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3885.1s	3885.1	 but also that I don't tend to vary my nutrition
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3888.2s	3888.2	 with my training quite as much as I should.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3890.0s	3890.0	 I'm just locked into a protocol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3894.3s	3894.3	 We covered a number of things related to your PhD thesis work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3898.1s	3898.1	 but I cut you off early on related to your trajectory.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3901.6s	3901.6	 After you finished your thesis,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3904.6s	3904.6	 I know you were at Notre Dame for a while.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3906.3s	3906.3	 Was that your first spot after your PhD thesis?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3909.7s	3909.7	 No, no.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3911.1s	3911.1	 I basically finished my PhD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3913.3s	3913.3	 and I dropped into the British Olympic system for about 14 years.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3916.9s	3916.9	 Oh, my.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3919.6s	3919.6	 I've done three full Olympic cycles with different sports,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3923.4s	3923.4	 and largely a strength and conditioning coach as a practitioner.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3927.7s	3927.7	 I was always working in universities and academia alongside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3931.8s	3931.8	 in terms of continuing to publish and write and do research and teach as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3936.9s	3936.9	 Because that explains the huge volume of publications.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3939.9s	3939.9	 I don't think people realize the work that goes into getting a quality peer-reviewed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3944.0s	3944.0	 publication.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3944.7s	3944.7	 It's not what do they call it now on Instagram?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3947.2s	3947.2	 Anic data, where people do something what they have this experience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3951.1s	3951.1	 and then they put in the world that it's that Anic data are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3955.1s	3955.1	 I don't even know that we should call it data,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3958.0s	3958.0	 so 14 years in working with the British Olympic team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3961.6s	3961.6	 Yeah, so whether it was GB boxing, primarily with the Beijing cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3968.7s	3968.7	 but also lightweight rowers and gymnastics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3971.6s	3971.6	 For the London Olympic Games, that cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3974.0s	3974.0	 I was the lead strength and conditioning and physical performance coach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3977.1s	3977.1	 for British basketball, so GB basketball.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3980.3s	3980.3	 I had about three years in the English Premier League
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3983.5s	3983.5	 and with Newcastle United and the soccer team.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3986.5s	3986.5	 And then for the Rio Olympic cycle, I was with GB taekwondo,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3989.7s	3989.7	 so again another combat sport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3992.5s	3992.5	 After I'd finished there, I kind of moved to the University of Notre Dame,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=3997.0s	3997.0	 where I went into more of a managerial position,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4000.8s	4000.8	 working across all the different technical services,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4003.6s	4003.6	 medical, nutrition, strength and conditioning, psychology,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4007.1s	4007.1	 and whatever, sports science, whatever it may be,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4010.0s	4010.0	 as the director of performance sciences for Notre Dame athletics.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4015.5s	4015.5	 And then after about 16 months there, the UFC came knocking,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4019.1s	4019.1	 and they recruited me out of Notre Dame.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4021.0s	4021.0	 So it's been a great ride.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4025.9s	4025.9	 Lots of athletes have taught me a lot along the way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4028.1s	4028.1	 lots of coaches.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4029.2s	4029.2	 Every day is a school day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4030.7s	4030.7	 I still try and keep that mentality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4032.8s	4032.8	 And in this world, we call it white belt mentality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4038.0s	4038.0	 I'm a PhD, I've got 25 years of experience in high performance sport,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4042.1s	4042.1	 but I still learn every single day from these people out on the mats
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4046.4s	4046.4	 and in the ring, and it's impressive to see what they do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4048.7s	4048.7	 Yeah, it certainly is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4049.6s	4049.6	 I got introduced to MMA just a few years ago.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4052.8s	4052.8	 I think the first time I came out here was one of the first times I'd heard of MMA,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4056.3s	4056.3	 because I was kind of in my laboratory, you know, nose down.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4059.5s	4059.5	 And it's a really interesting sport because it incorporates
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4061.5s	4061.5	 so many different types of movement, as you said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4064.7s	4064.7	 It's not just stand-up boxing, it's just kicking, it's ground game, everything.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4069.2s	4069.2	 And I'm still learning about it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4071.9s	4071.9	 But as you mentioned, going in with that beginner's mind,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4075.0s	4075.0	 the white belt mentality, what has been the most surprising thing for you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4083.1s	4083.1	 in terms of being exposed to MMA in particular as opposed to other sports?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4086.8s	4086.8	 Like, what's unique about MMA fighters besides that they have this huge variety
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4091.0s	4091.0	 of tactical skills that they have to learn and perfect?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4097.7s	4097.7	 Yeah, that's a great question.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4099.5s	4099.5	 I would say two things.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4100.3s	4100.3	 I'm going to answer two questions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4101.5s	4101.5	 One actually reiterates what you've already said.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4103.4s	4103.4	 Like, the degrees of freedom in mixed martial arts are exponential, like no other sport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4108.9s	4108.9	 You know, we've got 11 different weight classes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4111.9s	4111.9	 We have men's classes, we have women's classes, we have, you know, kickboxers, wrestlers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4116.9s	4116.9	 jujitsu fighters, judokas, you know, like karate fighters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4120.2s	4120.2	 You know, the stylistic backgrounds are infinite.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4123.3s	4123.3	 We have, we're a weight classification sport.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4125.9s	4125.9	 There's a whole issue relating to making weight and then rebounding to fight about 24 to 30 hours.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4131.7s	4131.7	 Like, just the variability in this sport, the considerations that you have to make
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4137.9s	4137.9	 are unprecedented compared to any other sport that I've worked with.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4142.1s	4142.1	 And a lot of them go against and are the antithesis of what you would expect for high performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4148.7s	4148.7	 You know, in terms of, we don't always have a very clearly defined competition schedule.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4154.9s	4154.9	 You know, once these guys fight, they don't necessarily know when their next fight is going to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4158.7s	4158.7	 What's the closest spacing of a fight?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4160.7s	4160.7	 I mean, listen, I think the record is around, it's just over a month, I believe.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4168.3s	4168.3	 So, you know, that's a quick turnaround.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4169.9s	4169.9	 But most of these guys are fighting, you know, three or four times a year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4173.5s	4173.5	 Three times a year is pretty normal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4185.5s	4185.5	 Like, are we taking some time off?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4196.8s	4196.8	 Absolutely.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4200.6s	4200.6	 There isn't this like, let's get ready for the season.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4208.2s	4208.2	 the Spanish open, the French open, the European championships, the Israeli open, the American open.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4220.0s	4220.0	 Here, it's a moving target because you might be just hanging out,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4223.1s	4223.1	 doing some general prep work, and then you might get a short notice fight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4226.1s	4226.1	 They give you a quick call and it's in six weeks or five weeks.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4228.6s	4228.6	 And okay, I've got to ramp everything up really quickly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4231.5s	4231.5	 So that's a real challenge in terms of just managing all these different components of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4237.5s	4237.5	 mixed martial arts alone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4249.1s	4249.1	 And again, we've touched on it in the talk, but, you know, the ability to do what they do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4253.1s	4253.1	 on a daily basis, to look at all the different skill sets that they have to try and engage in
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4259.5s	4259.5	 and bring into their training, to do that and embrace the grind, embrace the process of just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4266.1s	4266.1	 learning. The physical side of our sport is unprecedented, but the mental side, you know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4272.3s	4272.3	 we have a funny saying here, we always say it's 90% medical... 90% mental apart from the 60%

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4284.1s	4284.1	 just do that on a daily basis is very impressive. Like their resilience,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4289.7s	4289.7	 their internal drive and their resilience is really impressive to see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4294.3s	4294.3	 All the fighters I've met here have been really terrific. It's interesting. Every time I meet a

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4303.2s	4303.2	 always extremely polite. And fighting is such a... You know, it comes from a very primitive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4308.7s	4308.7	 portion of the brain, right? But a large portion of the brain nonetheless.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4312.4s	4312.4	 But I think that's another skill is that switch, you know? And again, that's the
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4315.8s	4315.8	 recoverability piece, right? Like you cannot be type A or you cannot be like supercharged
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4322.0s	4322.0	 24 hours a day because you're going to just fry your system, right? And I think that's something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4326.5s	4326.5	 else where we're really trying to manage this whole process, be it through nutritional
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4330.3s	4330.3	 interventions, be it through education around sleep, be it through training program management,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4336.4s	4336.4	 be it through psychological interventions. You know, you could look at fighters and say,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4341.2s	4341.2	 like, these guys are go, like they're red alert and they'll run through a brick wall. But actually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4346.1s	4346.1	 again, their ability to turn it on and off means that they can do what they do. You know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4350.3s	4350.3	 they can bring it down and be very normal, very polite, very, you know, accommodating.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4357.1s	4357.1	 Maybe even better than most people because, you know, one of the reasons I'm obsessed with
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4361.0s	4361.0	 human performance and high performance and people like fighters and, you know, elite military or
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4366.9s	4366.9	 or even bodybuilders for that matter is that they experiment. They find the outer limits of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4372.9s	4372.9	 what's possible. But one of the things that they have discovered as you're describing is this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4377.6s	4377.6	 ability to toggle between high alert states and calm states. Most typical people can't do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4383.6s	4383.6	 They see something that upsets them on the Internet or something on the news or some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4387.6s	4387.6	 external event pressures down on them. And they're stressed for many, many days and weeks. And
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4391.3s	4391.3	 sometimes it goes pathological, right? And this, I don't say this as a criticism. It's just that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4396.4s	4396.4	 most, most human beings within our species, most members of our species never learned to,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4402.0s	4402.0	 to either flip the switch or to just voluntarily toggle between states. I think athletes learn how
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4407.5s	4407.5	 to do that extremely well. And it sounds like MMA fighters do that even better than perhaps many
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4414.3s	4414.3	 other athletes. I mean, yeah, there's the odd one or two that we struggle with. But I think in terms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4418.9s	4418.9	 of that chronic exposure, we see that coming from challenges around, you know, cyclical weight cutting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4426.0s	4426.0	 and metabolic disruption and metabolic injury, not necessarily from the psychological drive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4431.3s	4431.3	 You know, they do, they do understand that this is a job for them. And the time on the mass,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4437.2s	4437.2	 most of them can turn it off a little bit and downgrade things when they're off the mats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4442.5s	4442.5	 It's impressive to see. Because again, like as a layman, just looking at the fight game, you think,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4448.3s	4448.3	 you know, it's going to be crazy chaotic, a hundred miles an hour, every hour of every day. But that's
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4453.9s	4453.9	 not, that's clearly not the case. They manage their energy and their efforts pretty well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4460.0s	4460.0	 So it's a little bit like science, although maybe scientists could take a lesson from it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4463.3s	4463.3	 Yeah. Evidence based practice or practice based evidence.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4466.4s	4466.4	 Oh, I like that. That's good. A couple more questions. I can't help myself. I know we
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4471.3s	4471.3	 talked about temperature earlier when we discussed cold, but I can't help myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4475.9s	4475.9	 I have to ask you about heat because earlier we were having a conversation about heat adaptation,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4481.7s	4481.7	 about how long does it take for the human body or athlete or typical person that's maybe exploring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4488.3s	4488.3	 sauna or things of that sort to learn to be a better sweater. It sounds like something
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4493.9s	4493.9	 none of us would want to do. We all want to stay cool, calm and collected. But one of the reasons
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4497.7s	4497.7	 to deliberately expose oneself to heat is for things like growth hormone release, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4503.6s	4503.6	 We can talk about this, but a couple of questions. One is heat exposure stress in the same way that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4509.6s	4509.6	 the ice bath or cold exposure is stress. The second one is, is there any difference there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4515.7s	4515.7	 that's important? And the other one is how does one get better at heat adaptation or at least what
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4520.7s	4520.7	 are you doing with the fighters to get them better at dealing with heat? How long does that take?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4524.7s	4524.7	 So the first question, just because I threw three questions at you, is, is heat stress like coldest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4532.6s	4532.6	 stress? Yeah, I think it is. And I think heat shock proteins, for example, are driven by that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4538.0s	4538.0	 stressful exposure to a changing environment. So I think, you know, it's, we do graded response
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4545.8s	4545.8	 in terms of heat acclimation strategies. But yes, we've touched on it earlier in the conversation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4551.9s	4551.9	 For me, heat is still a stressor. And if it's managed incorrectly, you can have detrimental
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4558.8s	4558.8	 responses rather than beneficial responses. So barring like hyperthermia and death, like,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4563.4s	4563.4	 I mean, obviously heat up the brain too much, people will have seizures and die,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4567.2s	4567.2	 but you lose neurons. But what's the right way to acclimate heat? Taking into account that people
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4573.6s	4573.6	 are, you know, should check with their doctor, et cetera. We do all these disclaimers, but,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4577.7s	4577.7	 you know, but let's say I, let's just say I want to get better at dealing with heat,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4581.5s	4581.5	 or I want to extract more benefit from heat. I mean, how many minutes a day are people typically

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMvtHqLmEkI&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=90&pp=iAQB&t=4684.4s	4684.4	 anything we build up in temperature, but we build up in volume of exposure. So, you know,
