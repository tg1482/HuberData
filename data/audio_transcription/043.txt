https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=865.7s	865.7	 is as your core temperature goes down,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=868.0s	868.0	 you will eventually shut off your heat loss.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=890.7s	890.7	 Right, for the anaerobic athlete,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=893.1s	893.1	 and let's say they're doing several,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=908.9s	908.9	 but the temperature of those muscles will go up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=913.1s	913.1	 It's a local effect, right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=918.5s	918.5	 if we assume that the basic workout,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=921.2s	921.2	 even though people do variation on this,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=930.5s	930.5	 of five repetitions or 10 sets of 10 repetitions,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=938.0s	938.0	 is doing a large body compound movement like barbell squats

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=952.5s	952.5	 they're involved, but more or less indirectly.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=954.8s	954.8	 Right.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=958.4s	958.4	 heat up the hamstrings, heat up the glutes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=960.4s	960.4	 this kind of thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=961.3s	961.3	 Right. I see.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=962.6s	962.6	 And then during rest, that heat will leave the muscle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=966.8s	966.8	 but it's not fast.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=968.9s	968.9	 And certainly the heat can't leave the muscle very fast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=971.6s	971.6	 while you're working out because when the muscle contracts,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=974.5s	974.5	 it squeezes the blood vessels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=976.5s	976.5	 And the only way heat gets out of a muscle is in the blood.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=980.5s	980.5	 And your muscle metabolism can go up 50 or 60 fold

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=987.8s	987.8	 goes up 50 or 60 fold.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1001.8s	1001.8	 to just mention briefly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1003.5s	1003.5	 what the underlying mechanism of this is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1020.1s	1020.1	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1022.4s	1022.4	 We don't get something for nothing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1025.2s	1025.2	 So like a steam engine,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1035.1s	1035.1	 So of the energy that we take in in our food,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1038.7s	1038.7	 about 20% of that can go into doing work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1040.5s	1040.5	 and the rest of it is lost as heat.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1042.9s	1042.9	 Now, we're mammals, we use that heat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1045.6s	1045.6	 to keep our body temperature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1047.0s	1047.0	 considerably above the environment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1054.2s	1054.2	 you're in trouble.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1055.7s	1055.7	 That's hyperthermia.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1057.9s	1057.9	 So individual muscles can reach hyperthermic limits
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1061.8s	1061.8	 before you might experience it in the whole body.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1065.6s	1065.6	 So to keep you from damaging your muscle by hyperthermia,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1070.7s	1070.7	 we have fail-safe mechanisms.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1072.6s	1072.6	 And one of those fail-safe mechanisms is an enzyme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1076.4s	1076.4	 which is critical for getting fuel,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1079.6s	1079.6	 in other words, the results of metabolism of glucose,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1084.4s	1084.4	 getting that fuel into the mitochondria,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1086.9s	1086.9	 which is making our major coinage of energy exchange ATP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1092.8s	1092.8	 So that particular enzyme is temperature sensitive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1096.9s	1096.9	 So when the muscle temperature gets above 39 or 39.5,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1100.7s	1100.7	 it shuts off.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1102.1s	1102.1	 And that essentially shuts off the fuel supply
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1105.3s	1105.3	 to the mitochondria.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1106.4s	1106.4	 That's when you cannot do one more rep.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1109.0s	1109.0	 So failure, could we say that one component
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1112.4s	1112.4	 of muscular failure is overheating of the muscle locally?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1116.2s	1116.2	 There are probably other things too.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1118.0s	1118.0	 Well, if you lack oxygen,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1120.6s	1120.6	 but our oxygen delivery is pretty good to the muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1125.1s	1125.1	 If you run out of glucose, yeah, that's going to impair you.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1128.3s	1128.3	 But the most immediate impairment of muscle activity,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1133.9s	1133.9	 muscle fatigue, in other words,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1135.6s	1135.6	 is the rise in temperature of the muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1137.7s	1137.7	 Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1139.7s	1139.7	 I want to talk about how that muscle fails locally,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1142.3s	1142.3	 but I have this burning question in my mind
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1144.5s	1144.5	 that I cannot seem to answer for myself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1148.0s	1148.0	 I'm hoping you can answer it for me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1149.5s	1149.5	 So let's say I'm doing five sets of five with squats.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1154.0s	1154.0	 I hit muscular failure at a given weight.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1157.4s	1157.4	 And according to what I now know,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1161.4s	1161.4	 it's my quadriceps and the muscles associated with the squat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1165.4s	1165.4	 that have failed because of this heat triggering,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1168.6s	1168.6	 this mechanism triggered by heat that shuts off the muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1171.7s	1171.7	 But my biceps are nice and cool, you're telling me.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1174.4s	1174.4	 They're not doing too much work, it's only indirect work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1177.5s	1177.5	 So why is it that I can't set the bar down in the squat rack,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1183.1s	1183.1	 walk over and do barbell curls with the same intensity

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1191.1s	1191.1	 not having done anything prior?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1193.0s	1193.0	 Well, you will still have a fatigue curve
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1195.5s	1195.5	 with your upper body, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1198.6s	1198.6	 And that will be influenced by any rise in temperature
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1202.4s	1202.4	 that has been generated by your lower body exercise.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1209.9s	1209.9	 It's one limiting factor, it's one limiting factor.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1213.3s	1213.3	 I find that amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1214.7s	1214.7	 I find that amazing because I always thought naively

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1225.1s	1225.1	 or some ability to access that glycogen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1228.6s	1228.6	 But of course we still have glycogen.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1231.0s	1231.0	 It's naive for me to think that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1232.2s	1232.2	 because if I wait three minutes and go back,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1234.5s	1234.5	 I can do those repetitions again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1236.0s	1236.0	 So the glycogen wasn't restored in that three minutes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1238.6s	1238.6	 Obviously it was there.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1240.2s	1240.2	 So I realized there might be other mechanisms involved.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1243.0s	1243.0	 Sounds like heat is if not the dominant mechanism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1247.0s	1247.0	 that prevents more work, it's one of them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1250.6s	1250.6	 It's one of them and it's a quick one, it's a fast one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1703.2s	1703.2	 It's actually testosterone converted into estrogen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1733.3s	1733.3	 that you can't have the information just coming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1771.7s	1771.7	 is more integrated representation of body temperature.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1776.4s	1776.4	 So it's sort of an average of what's happening.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1778.1s	1778.1	 It's an average.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1789.4s	1789.4	 but we were popsicles.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1894.5s	1894.5	 of high profile athletic deaths due to heat stroke

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1902.2s	1902.2	 not in competition when people are really trying to do it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1905.4s	1905.4	 but in practice,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1906.9s	1906.9	 which shows they were just motivated to push.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1910.5s	1910.5	 So let's talk about these magnificent portals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1913.9s	1913.9	 that not just humans, but other animals,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1918.8s	1918.8	 So if putting coal on the neck or on the head
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1922.4s	1922.4	 or on the torso is not optimal, what is optimal?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1926.5s	1926.5	 And maybe walk us through a theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1930.9s	1930.9	 as to why we would have these portals located
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1933.4s	1933.4	 where they are, and then we can talk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1935.2s	1935.2	 about how one might leverage them for performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1938.2s	1938.2	 Okay, where the portals are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1940.5s	1940.5	 are in the glabrous skin, big word, okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1945.4s	1945.4	 Glabrous just means no hair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1948.1s	1948.1	 So it's the hairless skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1949.6s	1949.6	 You say, well, most of my body is without hair.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1953.0s	1953.0	 No, most of your body has hair follicles.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1956.9s	1956.9	 We are mammals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1958.3s	1958.3	 Mammals have fur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1959.9s	1959.9	 We've lost the fur, but we still have those,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1963.3s	1963.3	 that hairy skin phenotype all over our body,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1966.3s	1966.3	 except for those skin surfaces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1970.1s	1970.1	 where our mammal relatives didn't have fur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1973.9s	1973.9	 So the pads of the feet,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1976.0s	1976.0	 and for the primates, upper part of the face,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1979.0s	1979.0	 for rabbits, no portions of the ears,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1982.3s	1982.3	 the inner surface of the ears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1984.2s	1984.2	 For bears, the tongue, bears have big tongues, huge tongues.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1990.0s	1990.0	 I didn't know that either.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1991.9s	1991.9	 I haven't been that close to a bear yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1994.2s	1994.2	 I've had a licking match with a bear.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1996.0s	1996.0	 Not yet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=1997.5s	1997.5	 So anyway, our mammalian relatives
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2003.3s	2003.3	 can't lose heat over their overall body surface.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2006.5s	2006.5	 So probably very early on in mammalian evolution,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2010.2s	2010.2	 they evolved these special blood vessels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2012.6s	2012.6	 in the limited surface areas that don't have fur.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2016.2s	2016.2	 And as I said, what these blood vessels are,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2018.9s	2018.9	 are shunts between the arteries and the veins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2022.2s	2022.2	 Arteries and veins are both low resistance vessels.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2025.6s	2025.6	 So you can have high flow rate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2027.5s	2027.5	 Capillaries, which normally are between arteries and veins,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2030.9s	2030.9	 are high resistance because they're very tiny.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2033.8s	2033.8	 Okay?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2034.6s	2034.6	 Is it fair to say that what I was taught
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2037.4s	2037.4	 is that blood flows from arteries, then to capillaries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2041.7s	2041.7	 and then to veins, and then back to the heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2043.8s	2043.8	 So it's sort of like from the heart through arteries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2046.0s	2046.0	 then through these little capillaries,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2047.8s	2047.8	 which are like little estuaries and streams,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2049.7s	2049.7	 and then to the veins back to the heart.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2051.4s	2051.4	 Is that generally true?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2052.8s	2052.8	 Yeah, absolutely.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2053.8s	2053.8	 So what I learned in basic physiology is still,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2056.7s	2056.7	 I wouldn't get an F in your class.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2058.7s	2058.7	 No.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2059.7s	2059.7	 Maybe a D or a C, but not an F.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2062.6s	2062.6	 So that's excellent.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2063.5s	2063.5	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2064.3s	2064.3	 And so you're saying that in this glabrous,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2066.5s	2066.5	 or beneath the glabrous skin.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2069.3s	2069.3	 There are these shunts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2070.9s	2070.9	 And those go directly from arteries to veins.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2073.9s	2073.9	 So you skip the capillaries.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2076.5s	2076.5	 Yeah.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2077.3s	2077.3	 And is it actually, as long as I say that in the skin,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2081.7s	2081.7	 when I feel the pads in my hands,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2085.7s	2085.7	 how deep to the surface do these vessels reside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2089.2s	2089.2	 They're below the, obviously, the epidermis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2095.7s	2095.7	 So if you are warm, and you look at the palms of your hands,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2100.1s	2100.1	 they are fairly red.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2102.4s	2102.4	 The backs of your hands aren't.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2104.4s	2104.4	 You don't have these vessels in the backs of your hands.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2106.8s	2106.8	 Now, if you take a glass, like a water tumbler, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2112.1s	2112.1	 And you grab it, you can see if you squeeze a little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2116.7s	2116.7	 the hand goes white.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2119.0s	2119.0	 That's because you've shut off that blood flow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2121.6s	2121.6	 Oh, interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2122.5s	2122.5	 I'm gonna do that little home experiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2123.9s	2123.9	 So if you're bicycling on a hot day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2126.3s	2126.3	 you don't wanna be grabbing your handlebars all the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2128.9s	2128.9	 You wanna periodically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2131.6s	2131.6	 I know you're privy to some really amazing results
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2135.3s	2135.3	 that we're gonna talk about,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2136.2s	2136.2	 but I actually heard you say this during this lecture
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2138.8s	2138.8	 recently that Stanford held about human performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2141.7s	2141.7	 that we were both part of.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2143.3s	2143.3	 And you mentioned this, that if you're cycling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2146.5s	2146.5	 and you're working hard
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2147.9s	2147.9	 and you want to be able to do more work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2149.9s	2149.9	 we now know why you wanna remain cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2152.6s	2152.6	 in order to continue to do work.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2673.5s	2673.5	 Can he do it inside of a three minute rest period?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2675.5s	2675.5	 Yeah, that's what we were doing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2676.7s	2676.7	 We standardized the interval for resting or cooling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2680.9s	2680.9	 to three minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2686.5s	2686.5	 and all of the sets were above
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2688.2s	2688.2	 what he had done on the previous day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2690.6s	2690.6	 And he said, you know, I'm not tired, I can do another set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2693.9s	2693.9	 And then I can do another set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2696.4s	2696.4	 I can do another set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2697.8s	2697.8	 I can do another set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2698.7s	2698.7	 So from one day to two or three days later with cooling,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2703.5s	2703.5	 he doubled the total work volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2707.3s	2707.3	 He doubled the total number of dips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2708.7s	2708.7	 By adding more sets and more repetitions to each set.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2712.2s	2712.2	 Right.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2713.3s	2713.3	 So then he kept coming back for four more weeks,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2717.8s	2717.8	 twice a week.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2718.9s	2718.9	 And by the end of that month, he was doing 300 dips.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2724.9s	2724.9	 Wow, so what percentage-
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2725.7s	2725.7	 So he tripled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2726.5s	2726.5	 He tripled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2727.4s	2727.4	 He tripled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2728.2s	2728.2	 And so here's a professional athlete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2730.5s	2730.5	 at peak physical conditioning

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2734.9s	2734.9	 Amazing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2735.9s	2735.9	 And in terms of his ability to recover,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2739.1s	2739.1	 was that explored or discussed at all?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2742.1s	2742.1	 Because my understanding is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2744.0s	2744.0	 if we cause enough stress to a muscle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2747.8s	2747.8	 during anaerobic training,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2749.7s	2749.7	 we provide the stimulus for compensatory regrowth, et cetera.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2754.1s	2754.1	 But if we do more work,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2756.9s	2756.9	 we essentially scale up the amount of recovery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2759.2s	2759.2	 that's needed or the recovery time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2760.7s	2760.7	 I'm very curious about whether or not he needed longer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2763.1s	2763.1	 to recover between these super performing workouts.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2766.0s	2766.0	 That's very interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2767.5s	2767.5	 That was a major discovery,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2769.8s	2769.8	 which we didn't realize we were making at the time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2773.5s	2773.5	 There is this phenomenon you're referring to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2775.6s	2775.6	 as delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMs.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2779.1s	2779.1	 And this is due to those little micro tears and so forth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2782.4s	2782.4	 that are happening as we extend our workout capacity volume.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2789.3s	2789.3	 Okay.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2790.2s	2790.2	 So we've had this experience so many times
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2793.8s	2793.8	 that an athlete or anyone will come in to the lab

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2800.2s	2800.2	 their previous expectations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2804.9s	2804.9	 I'm going to be so sore tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2807.7s	2807.7	 They never are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2809.3s	2809.3	 Interesting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2810.2s	2810.2	 And we've actually demonstrated that with a naive group.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2813.4s	2813.4	 We had a class, a physical conditioning class,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2818.2s	2818.2	 and we had half of them,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2821.7s	2821.7	 the first days of the class,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2823.0s	2823.0	 we had to establish their true capacity, what they could do.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2827.2s	2827.2	 So this were pretty heavy workouts for these new recruits.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2831.3s	2831.3	 And we gave half of them the benefit of cooling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2834.7s	2834.7	 and the other half not.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2836.2s	2836.2	 And then we had them record their subjective levels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2839.3s	2839.3	 of delayed onset muscle soreness.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2881.1s	2881.1	 you can carry it to the gym or to the football field.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2909.5s	2909.5	 I probably just offended all the golfers out there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2956.3s	2956.3	 he gave an addendum to the report and he said,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2959.4s	2959.4	 well, I'll tell you this, after I've gotten home,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=2962.7s	2962.7	 it's added that technology.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3024.9s	3024.9	 but they have to stay in cool locations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3086.8s	3086.8	 maybe 18 subjects just off the street.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3387.9s	3387.9	 they said, well, when I'm running,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3397.2s	3397.2	 from that hand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3401.9s	3401.9	 Well, I have a feeling that there are people now doing that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3404.7s	3404.7	 as well as trying this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3406.8s	3406.8	 So how long in the cool mitt at the proper temperature,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3411.6s	3411.6	 how long are people putting their hands into the mitt?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=3415.5s	3415.5	 We once again had just standardized on three minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4035.5s	4035.5	 did we get everything wrong?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4041.1s	4041.1	 to heat up a hypothermic person in that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4064.0s	4064.0	 with a colleague in the Department of Anesthesia.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4071.4s	4071.4	 he said, yeah, you guys think you know so much

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4079.9s	4079.9	 Well, the patients come out of surgery,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4081.7s	4081.7	 they're hypothermic and it takes us hours

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4088.6s	4088.6	 They do exactly what you suggested.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4108.4s	4108.4	 you're vasodilated.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4118.3s	4118.3	 So we got the idea that, well, if we could just take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4121.3s	4121.3	 one appendage, like an arm, and we put it in a environment

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4135.1s	4135.1	 and it would warm the body up faster.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4137.4s	4137.4	 So my colleague built a prototype device.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4142.0s	4142.0	 You couldn't get such a device into the hospital these days.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4145.9s	4145.9	 But we were with our anesthesiologist friend.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4149.7s	4149.7	 We took it into the recovery room,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4151.8s	4151.8	 and the first thing the patient said, no way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4155.5s	4155.5	 You're not gonna put that on my patient.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4163.0s	4163.0	 First patient was back to normal temperature,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=4174.1s	4174.1	 I don't get upset about the,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5011.0s	5011.0	 around performance, as you mentioned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5012.5s	5012.5	 has to do with when you go to a new environment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5036.2s	5036.2	 under variable conditions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5040.2s	5040.2	 unpredictable conditions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5045.3s	5045.3	 I'm curious about this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5046.6s	5046.6	 Yeah, because everybody has always said to us,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5048.8s	5048.8	 well, you only use male subjects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5051.3s	5051.3	 and obviously they have this testosterone background.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5054.5s	5054.5	 They have higher levels of testosterone.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5056.4s	5056.4	 That's why you get these results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5058.2s	5058.2	 So we did a comparative study on females.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5060.8s	5060.8	 We get the same results.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5062.8s	5062.8	 Impressive.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5063.7s	5063.7	 And these are our Stanford athletes or also?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5065.9s	5065.9	 No, these were not Stanford athletes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5067.3s	5067.3	 They were Stanford students, but not athletes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5071.2s	5071.2	 Well, we have done, of course, work on some athletes,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5074.0s	5074.0	 but in general, we don't do research on our teams,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5077.5s	5077.5	 our varsity teams.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5082.5s	5082.5	 They don't like us to get too close to them.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5084.6s	5084.6	 No, I work with some of these folks in the coaches
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5086.7s	5086.7	 and they're very skeptical with good reason.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5089.0s	5089.0	 Also, and the reason I ask is that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5092.0s	5092.0	 when you see these Pac-10 or Division I college athletes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5096.4s	5096.4	 and then you see their peers,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5097.8s	5097.8	 there's clearly a difference, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5101.3s	5101.3	 I mean, they are pedigreed throughout, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5106.3s	5106.3	 And more typical folks also have different goals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5110.4s	5110.4	 They may not want to get infinitely stronger
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5113.2s	5113.2	 or perform more endurance work.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5116.0s	5116.0	 So I want to ask you a couple of things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5118.2s	5118.2	 about shivering and metabolism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5121.0s	5121.0	 because I think they're very interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5123.0s	5123.0	 and sufficiently related.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5125.2s	5125.2	 So my understanding is that shiver is an adaptation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5130.0s	5130.0	 that's designed to heat us up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5131.6s	5131.6	 Yes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5132.7s	5132.7	 That we have brown fat that's in compartments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5136.9s	5136.9	 around our body that are activated by shiver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5139.7s	5139.7	 or co-activated by shiver

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5146.6s	5146.6	 Is that true?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5148.1s	5148.1	 And does it require that cold be the stimulus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5151.7s	5151.7	 Two scenarios, I'll give you an experiment.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5153.3s	5153.3	 I put someone into cold water of some sort
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5156.1s	5156.1	 and then I make them get out or I have them stand near it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5158.6s	5158.6	 and then they start shivering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5159.9s	5159.9	 My understanding is that their metabolism will increase.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5163.8s	5163.8	 What if I take someone and I just have them shiver
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5166.9s	5166.9	 but they're not exposed by cold?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5168.2s	5168.2	 It's kind of a deliberate shivering.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5170.0s	5170.0	 Will that also create a substantial increase in metabolism?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5174.8s	5174.8	 Sure.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5175.6s	5175.6	 So deliberate shivering without cold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5179.3s	5179.3	 is essentially what happens when you get a fever.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5182.6s	5182.6	 Your set point goes up and you're hypothalamus

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5188.8s	5188.8	 your thermostat is telling you you're too cold.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5194.6s	5194.6	 So sure, shivering is a good way of increasing metabolism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5199.2s	5199.2	 but it only can take metabolism up
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5201.1s	5201.1	 maybe three or four times resting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5221.1s	5221.1	 A bear, actually we've done a lot of work on bears.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5226.4s	5226.4	 Do you also put the nose thermocouple down in the esophagus?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=5229.4s	5229.4	 We implant them surgically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6023.6s	6023.6	 are acting to prevent optimal performance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6027.6s	6027.6	 or reduce performance?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6029.4s	6029.4	 I don't think that the temperature rise

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6035.8s	6035.8	 But what it does is it makes you more jittery
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6038.9s	6038.9	 and you're going to increase that neat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6041.0s	6041.0	 that you were talking about.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6043.6s	6043.6	 Or it's another thing,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6044.4s	6044.4	 and that is that when you are exercising your muscle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6048.8s	6048.8	 and it becomes slightly hypoxic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6052.4s	6052.4	 I mean, the oxygen supply is not enough,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6056.9s	6056.9	 the muscle releases adenosine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6061.9s	6061.9	 is cause the blood vessels to open up, to dilate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6065.7s	6065.7	 So it's a way of increasing the blood flow to the muscle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6069.3s	6069.3	 and therefore the oxygen supply to the muscle.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6071.7s	6071.7	 So caffeine is essentially an adenosine antagonist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6074.9s	6074.9	 The adenosine antagonist, right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6076.8s	6076.8	 So under the strict logic,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6080.2s	6080.2	 ingesting caffeine will reduce adenosine release

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6087.5s	6087.5	 So that would lead me to believe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6089.5s	6089.5	 that motivational support aside,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6093.4s	6093.4	 that caffeine will hinder muscular performance.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6097.1s	6097.1	 I would think so,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6098.2s	6098.2	 but I can't give you an authoritative answer on that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6103.2s	6103.2	 Okay, well, we're just going through the logic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6106.4s	6106.4	 and the gymnastics around that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6109.9s	6109.9	 I think it's a fascinating area that deserves attention
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6112.5s	6112.5	 because the question of what one can ingest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6116.4s	6116.4	 in order to perform better,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6118.9s	6118.9	 to say nothing of hormone augmentation,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6128.1s	6128.1	 most of which include caffeine of some sort,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6140.0s	6140.0	 might be the better option.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6142.5s	6142.5	 I just am not aware of data that would...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6150.4s	6150.4	 and blood flow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77CdVSpnUX4&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=95&pp=iAQB&t=6389.9s	6389.9	 and you're hot, so you throw them off.
