https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=2.3s	2.3	 where we discuss science
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=3.7s	3.7	 and science-based tools for everyday life.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=9.4s	9.4	 I'm Andrew Huberman,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=13.2s	13.2	 at Stanford School of Medicine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=15.2s	15.2	 Today, we're talking all about fasting.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=18.0s	18.0	 And anytime we're talking about fasting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=20.3s	20.3	 we are also talking about eating,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=22.0s	22.0	 because we all need to eat sooner or later.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=24.7s	24.7	 We're going to talk about how fasting and when we eat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=28.8s	28.8	 influences a large range of aspects
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=31.7s	31.7	 of our health and wellbeing, both physical and mental.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=35.6s	35.6	 So, while nowadays most people are familiar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=38.6s	38.6	 with the term intermittent fasting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=40.8s	40.8	 also sometimes called time-restricted feeding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=44.0s	44.0	 I think most people don't really understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=46.4s	46.4	 how that process works.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=48.1s	48.1	 It's sort of obvious that intermittent fasting,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=50.5s	50.5	 aka time-restricted feeding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=52.7s	52.7	 involves eating at certain periods of each 24-hour cycle,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=56.3s	56.3	 or maybe even not eating for entire days, in some cases.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=60.2s	60.2	 But if you think about it, everybody sleeps eventually,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=63.8s	63.8	 and therefore, because people don't eat during their sleep,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=68.2s	68.2	 almost everybody is employing some form

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=125.1s	125.1	 In fact, I'm going to discuss a number of tools
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=127.6s	127.6	 during today's episode that actually make it such
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=130.5s	130.5	 that you don't have to follow any feeding schedule
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=134.7s	134.7	 or fasting schedule, same thing, if you think about it,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=137.9s	137.9	 in any absolutely strict regimented way,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=145.1s	145.1	 during an eight-hour period of each day, most of the time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=147.9s	147.9	 but then occasionally eat across a 12-hour period of the day,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=151.7s	151.7	 in theory, that could actually have pretty serious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=154.7s	154.7	 detrimental health effects.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=158.2s	158.2	 to attenuate those negative effects.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=160.3s	160.3	 In fact, there are things that you can do and or take
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=163.5s	163.5	 that can make it as if you did not eat at all.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=166.5s	166.5	 And so, we'll discuss what those tools are.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=168.9s	168.9	 And in many cases, for sake of health, weight loss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=171.7s	171.7	 and performance, making the body think that it did not eat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=175.4s	175.4	 at all can actually be quite beneficial.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=177.9s	177.9	 So today we're going to cover mechanism
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=179.8s	179.8	 and we're going to cover tools.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=181.0s	181.0	 Before we do that, I want to highlight a particular result
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=184.2s	184.2	 that was published recently because it serves

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=188.2s	188.2	 into the conversation about fasting.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=192.9s	192.9	 in the journal Cell Metabolism,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=194.9s	194.9	 a cell press journal, excellent journal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=206.1s	206.1	 in translation part means in a moment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=210.1s	210.1	 and I should mention that the first author
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=211.7s	211.7	 of the study is Palyaguru, P-A-L-L-I-Y-A-G-U-R-U, guru.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=219.2s	219.2	 Palyaguru at all, the basic finding of the study is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=224.5s	224.5	 that in humans, higher blood glucose is associated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=230.0s	230.0	 with mortality.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=234.3s	234.3	 resting blood glucose across the lifespan,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=236.6s	236.6	 what you find is as people age,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=238.8s	238.8	 resting blood glucose goes up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=240.9s	240.9	 Now this is very interesting because for a long time,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=243.8s	243.8	 it was thought that metabolism actually goes down as we age.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=246.9s	246.9	 And to some extent that's true,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=248.9s	248.9	 but the reductions in metabolism are not nearly as robust
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=252.2s	252.2	 as we once thought that they were across the lifespan.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=255.1s	255.1	 However, unless there's something done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=258.0s	258.0	 to mitigate the increase in blood glucose associated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=260.7s	260.7	 with aging, almost everybody experiences a gradual,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=265.6s	265.6	 but regular increase in resting blood glucose
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=268.3s	268.3	 that predicts mortality.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=270.4s	270.4	 Now the title, as I mentioned,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=271.7s	271.7	 is Fasting Blood Glucose as a Predictor of Mortality,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=274.7s	274.7	 Lost in Translation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=276.0s	276.0	 And the reason that they included lost in translation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=278.6s	278.6	 in the title is that what I just told you,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=281.3s	281.3	 that increases in resting blood glucose predict mortality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=284.7s	284.7	 or are correlated with mortality is true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=287.3s	287.3	 for human beings and for non-human primates, monkeys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=290.9s	290.9	 But the opposite is true in mice.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=293.7s	293.7	 And so I thought it was important to use this study

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1648.9s	1648.9	 you just have to do it at least once.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1650.5s	1650.5	 It doesn't taste very good.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1653.7s	1653.7	 And I confess that I only had the tiniest little bit,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1655.7s	1655.7	 but mice like that stuff.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1659.4s	1659.4	 what's called ad libitum, whenever they want,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1669.8s	1669.8	 where they gave them mouse chow in a time-restricted way,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1672.9s	1672.9	 just for a certain number of hours each day,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1681.4s	1681.4	 That was a separate group, got a high-fat diet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1683.5s	1683.5	 at any time they wanted.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1686.7s	1686.7	 because mice really like high-fat, highly palatable foods.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1693.3s	1693.3	 And then there was a fourth group
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1694.6s	1694.6	 that had access to the high-fat diet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1710.5s	1710.5	 and in the evening, not so much in the afternoon.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1712.9s	1712.9	 But nonetheless, everything I'm going to tell you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1717.2s	1717.2	 is true also for humans.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=1739.1s	1739.1	 same amount of calories,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4372.9s	4372.9	 and from our cages.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4379.9s	4379.9	 there are things that we can all do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4402.6s	4402.6	 So throughout this episode,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4404.4s	4404.4	 I've more or less been alluding to the fact

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4442.2s	4442.2	 And I want to emphasize that the term fed state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4445.6s	4445.6	 is probably a better way to think about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4448.1s	4448.1	 than eating or not eating,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4453.4s	4453.4	 I'm fasting now, but you're not actually fasting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4471.3s	4471.3	 I think that should be intuitive to understand.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4476.9s	4476.9	 which is glucose clearing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4503.0s	4503.0	 that ended at 8 p.m. and then plop to the couch,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4577.4s	4577.4	 of any kind does to blood glucose.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=4593.1s	4593.1	 high intensity interval training,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5551.2s	5551.2	 There's at least one study that's explored the effects

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5560.7s	5560.7	 This was a study by Morrow et al
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5563.1s	5563.1	 that was performed on elite cyclists.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5566.7s	5566.7	 It was a randomized control trial,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5571.6s	5571.6	 is that it explored a number of different hormonal

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5587.0s	5587.0	 was actually pretty considerable, 4,800 calories.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5590.3s	5590.3	 So that's a lot of calories.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5606.9s	5606.9	 Although there were some positive effects

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5637.5s	5637.5	 was that time-restricted feeding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5660.6s	5660.6	 to that and think, oh, well then maybe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5662.4s	5662.4	 time-restricted feeding is not for me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5666.2s	5666.2	 One is while the decrease in free testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5670.4s	5670.4	 was significant, it's also going to depend
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5672.6s	5672.6	 on where people start out.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5674.0s	5674.0	 So if somebody has already low or modest levels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5677.0s	5677.0	 of testosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5679.9s	5679.9	 that could lead them into a state
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5681.9s	5681.9	 of poor performance and wellbeing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5683.8s	5683.8	 Whereas if somebody has higher testosterone,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5686.0s	5686.0	 a decrease won't necessarily do that.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5687.9s	5687.9	 So it's important to take that into consideration.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5690.1s	5690.1	 This is why I'm always such a fan

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5696.6s	5696.6	 A very interesting change in hormonal profile

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5710.9s	5710.9	 or to have peaks in cortisol late in the day.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5713.6s	5713.6	 It's actually correlated with depression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5715.1s	5715.1	 and a number of other untoward things.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5744.7s	5744.7	 And the two groups did differ significantly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5750.7s	5750.7	 at one hormone, testosterone, you'd say,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5755.9s	5755.9	 is reducing testosterone levels significantly,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5762.6s	5762.6	 But in fact, because cortisol is lower,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5765.7s	5765.7	 it may mean that the effects of testosterone
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5768.2s	5768.2	 or the reduction in testosterone is offset.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5780.2s	5780.2	 So it is interesting and important to look
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5782.4s	5782.4	 at the total gallery of hormones.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5793.8s	5793.8	 this early pioneering study on time-restricted feeding,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5797.0s	5797.0	 they saw reductions in stress hormones

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5806.2s	5806.2	 So the takeaway is for sake of hormone health,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5810.5s	5810.5	 time-restricted feeding is compatible

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5822.6s	5822.6	 to less than eight hours,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5860.0s	5860.0	 will be right for you,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5867.7s	5867.7	 even high-performing elite athletes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tRohh0gErM&list=UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg&index=94&pp=iAQB&t=5887.5s	5887.5	 that you would start to increase
